;; 7. **Test Description:** Include `unreachable` in a `loop` body, and use `br` and `br_if` instructions to exit the loop conditionally, ensuring that the loop hits `unreachable` if conditions are unmet.    - **Constraint Checked:** Validates correct loop exits before hitting `unreachable`.    - **Incorrect Branch Target Relation:** Ensures that the conditional exits from loops compute branch targets accurately and trap if incorrect.
