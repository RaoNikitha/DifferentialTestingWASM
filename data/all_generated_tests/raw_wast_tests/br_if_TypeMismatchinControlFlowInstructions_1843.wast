;; 4. **Test 4: Uninitialized Operand on Conditional Branch**    - **Description**: Attempt to use `br_if` without the operand that determines the condition for branching on the stack.    - **Constraint Checked**: Check that both implementations properly validate the presence of the conditional operand.    - **Relation to Type Mismatch**: Missing conditional operand affects the stack and may lead to unexpected type mismatches downstream.
