;; 10. **Test Description: Multiple Conditional Loops with Dynamic Control Flow Paths**    - Design multiple conditional loops where `br_if` results in complex dynamic control flows, potentially leading to stack polymorphism violations if improperly managed.    - **Constraint Check**: Validate stack polymorphism handling across varied control flow executions.    - **CFG Relevance**: Ensures CFG accurately manages dynamic and polymorphic stack states.
