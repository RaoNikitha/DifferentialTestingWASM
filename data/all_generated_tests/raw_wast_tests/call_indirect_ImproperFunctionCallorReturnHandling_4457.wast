;; 6. **Test Description:** Create scenarios where `call_indirect` is invoked with insufficient operands on the stack, leading to operand stack underflow to ensure robust error handling.    - **Constraint:** Checks stack underflow conditions.    - **Improper Handling Relation:** Missing operands could lead to unexpected behavior or execution of invalid instructions.
