;; 7. **Return after Loop with Conditional Branching**:    - Implement a function with loops that contain conditional branches (`br_if`), finishing with a return instruction. Test to see if the return correctly evaluates the function's final state.    - **Reasoning**: Verifies operand stack management and ensures that loop contexts donâ€™t interfere with return instruction behavior.
