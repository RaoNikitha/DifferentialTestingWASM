;; 6. **Test Description:**    Implement a `br_if` within a `loop` with a complex boolean condition using `&&` and `||`. Verify the `br_if` correctly handles all boolean logic paths and branches appropriately.    - **Constraint Checked:** Handling complex boolean conditions within `br_if` inside loops.    - **Relation to Incorrect Condition Evaluation:** Avoid incorrect branching by improper evaluation of boolean conditions.
