;; 5. **Test Description**: Create a deeply nested block hierarchy with multiple branching instructions (`br`, `br_if`, `br_table`) aimed at various block levels. The expected outcome tests for correct block and branch resolution.    - **Constraint**: Confirm the robustness of deep nesting and branch resolution to respective blocks.    - **Nesting Mismanagement Check**: Tests accurate handling of deep nesting with multiple branching instructions.
