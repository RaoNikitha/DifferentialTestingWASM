;; 9. **Loop with Conditional Branch Within Unreachable Path**:    - Implement a loop with a conditional branch inside a block that contains an `unreachable` instruction and should naturally lead away from the `unreachable`.    - **Constraint**: Validates conditional branching paths within correct contexts.    - **Relation to Unreachable Code Execution**: Ensures that paths conditionally leading away from `unreachable` do not inadvertently trigger it.
