;; 10. **Test 10: Incorrect Label Depth Reference Leading to Unreachable**    - Establish nested control blocks (block, loop, if) within which the `br` references a misinterpreted depth label resulting in imperfect branching and an `unreachable` instruction placed next.    - Assesses if the `br` implementation misinterprets the depth, leading to the execution of the `unreachable` instruction.
