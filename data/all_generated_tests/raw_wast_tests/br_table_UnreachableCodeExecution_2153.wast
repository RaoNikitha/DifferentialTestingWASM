;; 3. **Test Description**: A `br_table` with multiple label vectors where one vector is intentionally set with a mismatched operand stack type, leading to an `unreachable` instruction when this branch is reached. This tests the implementationâ€™s ability to handle operand type mismatches gracefully.
