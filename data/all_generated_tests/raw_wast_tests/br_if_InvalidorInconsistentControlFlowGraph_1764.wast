;; 5. **Test Description**: Create a `block` containing a `loop` with multiple `br_if` instructions targeting the block. Check if the result types at each branch point are respected and appropriately handled.    - **Constraint Checked**: Results type consistency in multiple branches.    - **CFG Relation**: Ensures CFG consistency in exits from loops to blocks, maintaining stack state.
