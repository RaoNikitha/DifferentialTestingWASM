;; 1. **Test Description:**    Create a test with deeply nested loops where an `unreachable` instruction appears in the innermost loop, and a `br_table` targets varying depths incorrectly managing the loop exits.    *Constraint Checked:* Ensure correct evaluation of loop depth and immediate trap behavior when `unreachable` is executed.    *Mismanagement Focus:* Verify that the `br_table` does not incorrectly exit multiple nested loops upon encountering `unreachable`.
