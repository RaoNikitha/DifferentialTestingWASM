;; 10. **Mixed Control Flow Instructions with Nop**: Design a complex control flow involving `if`, `block`, `loop`, and `br` that includes strategically placed `nops`. The test should verify if the branches correctly resolve the intended targets by ensuring `nop` does not mislead the branch resolution in the intricate control flow scenario.
