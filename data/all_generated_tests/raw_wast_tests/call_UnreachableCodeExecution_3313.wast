;; 2. **Test Description**:    - **Scenario**: Define a function that takes no arguments and place an `unreachable` instruction right after calling this function. Ensure the stack has some elements before the call.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensure argument check and stack alignment are handled correctly.    - **Unreachable Code Execution**: If the argument expectations are not met correctly, the `unreachable` instruction should not be erroneously reached due to a stack handling bug.    - **Expected Differential Behaviour**: wizard_engine should trap during function call if stack alignment is incorrect, whereas the WebAssembly implementation might only trap at the `unreachable` step.
