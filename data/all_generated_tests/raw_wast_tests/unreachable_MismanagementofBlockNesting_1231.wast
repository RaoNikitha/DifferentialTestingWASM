;; 2. **Test Description:** Using `unreachable` inside a loop followed by a `block` containing valid instructions. It ensures that the loop terminates correctly and does not incorrectly fall through to the outer block due to mismanagement of block depth.        **Constraint Checked:** Proper termination and trap handling within nested loops and blocks.
