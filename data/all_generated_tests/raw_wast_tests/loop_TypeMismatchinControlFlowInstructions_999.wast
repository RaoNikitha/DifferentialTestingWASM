;; 10. **Type Enforcement Failures in `br_if` within Loop**:    - A conditional branch (`br_if`) within a loop structured to push mismatching type results conditional on various runtime states.    - Tests if `br_if` correctly enforces branch target type matching within the loopâ€™s block type constraints.    - Specific Constraint: Validation of type checking in conditional branches within loop bodies.
