;; 7. **Test Description:**    - Design a loop that uses `br_table` to branch to multiple targets. Include scenarios where some entries in the `br_table` have incorrect type associations.    - **Constraint Checking:** Tests the correctness of type verification for multiple branch targets within `br_table`.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops:** Incorrect type associations can lead to an absence of proper branching conditions, causing the loop to run endlessly.
