;; 1. **Test Description:** A function contains multiple nested blocks and loops, with the innermost block making indirect function calls and ending with a `br` instruction targeting an outer block.    **Constraint Checked:** Ensure `br` correctly resolves the outer block label.    **Relation to Function Call/Return Handling:** Misplaced stack unwinding might corrupt the call stack if `br` doesnâ€™t correctly jump outwards, leading to improper function call returns.
