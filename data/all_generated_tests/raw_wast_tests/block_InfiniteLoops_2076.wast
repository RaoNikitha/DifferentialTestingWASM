;; 7. **Test Description:**    A block enclosing a loop with intermediate `end` instructions misinterpreted, causing a loop with no proper exit condition.      **Constraint Checked:** Well-nested blocks and correct matching of `end` instructions.      **Relation to Infinite Loops:** Ensures correct nesting and termination of blocks to prevent infinite loops due to nesting errors.
