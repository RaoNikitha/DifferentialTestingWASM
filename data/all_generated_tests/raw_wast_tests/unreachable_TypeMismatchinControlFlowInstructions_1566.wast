;; 7. **Test 7: Mixed Block and Loop with Unexpected Type Results and Unreachable**    - A combination of `block` and `loop` instructions where an `unreachable` impacts the inferred and expected stack types across looping structures.    - **Constraint Checked:** Evaluates type propagation and control flow type expectations involving nested blocks and loops with unreachable.
