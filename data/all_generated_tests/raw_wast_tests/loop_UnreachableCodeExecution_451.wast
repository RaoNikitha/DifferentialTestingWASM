;; 2. **Loop with Conditional Branch to Unreachable**:    - Test a loop with a conditional `br_if` branch that mistakenly targets an `unreachable` instruction based on faulty conditions set within the loop.    - **Constraint**: This test verifies the handling of conditionals within loops and accurate evaluation to avoid unintentional `unreachable` code paths.    - **Unreachable Code Execution**: Validates that proper condition must be met before branching to an `unreachable` statement.
