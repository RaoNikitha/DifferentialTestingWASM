;; 6. **Test Description 6:**    - Use a deeply nested loop with mixed control instructions (`block`, `if`, `loop`) where a `br` targets a `block` from within a nested loop, but fails due to improper stack unwinding, causing the loop to repeat.    - **Constraint: Stack Polymorphism**    - **Relation to Infinite Loop:** Stack unwinding errors lead to infinite looping.
