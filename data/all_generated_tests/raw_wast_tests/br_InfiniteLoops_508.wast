;; 9. **Test Description:**    - Form a test case where a loop contains a nested `if` block that uses `br` to break out of both the `if` block and the loop. Introduce a type mismatch in the operands required by the `if` block.    - **Constraint Checking:** Verifies the handling of type checking within nested `if` blocks and loops.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops:** If the `if` block's `br` fails to execute correctly, the loop may continue indefinitely.
