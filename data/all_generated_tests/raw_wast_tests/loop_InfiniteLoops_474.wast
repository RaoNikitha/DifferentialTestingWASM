;; 5. **Test Description**: Embed a sequence of `loop` instructions with increasing operand stack complexity, ensuring that each loop references the correct input and output types. Errors in handling these types can cause the loops to never exit.    **Constraint**: Type validation for multi-level loops and checking stack consistency.    **Infinite Loop Relevance**: Tests if complex stack manipulations do not result in infinite execution.
