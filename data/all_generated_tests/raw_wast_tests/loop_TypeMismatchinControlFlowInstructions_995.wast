;; 6. **Controlled Stack Winding with Mismatching Types**:    - A loop where the operand stack is emptied and refilled with a type mismatch during execution and re-entry.    - Tests stack unwinding and rewinding behavior matching types accurately.    - Specific Constraint: Ensuring type consistency during stack unwinding and re-population in a loop body.
