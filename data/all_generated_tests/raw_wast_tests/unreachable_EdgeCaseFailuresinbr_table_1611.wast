;; 2. **Test Description:**     A `br_table` instruction in a loop with its index dynamically set via stack operations, followed by the `unreachable` instruction within a conditional branch that triggers based on a specific condition.    **Constraint Checked:** Verifies how the dynamic stack interaction and conditional logic influence the handling of `br_table` and the trap from `unreachable`.    **Edge Case Relation:** Ensures handling of complex control flows with dynamic indices in `br_table`.
