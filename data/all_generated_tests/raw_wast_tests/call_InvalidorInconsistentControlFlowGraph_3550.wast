;; 9. **Test with Invalid Control Transfer via Calls**:     - **Description**: Attempt to perform a call within an invalid control transfer context, such as during an ongoing conditional branch.     - **Constraint Checked**: Validates proper handling of control transfer boundaries.     - **CFG Relation**: Ensures the CFG maintains a valid control flow without allowing incorrect state transitions.
