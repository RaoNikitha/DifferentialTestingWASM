;; 1. **Test 1**: Create a deeply nested block and then insert a `br` instruction targeting a label index greater than the number of enclosing blocks. This tests the Wizard Engineâ€™s ability to correctly identify that the target label is not valid due to mismanagement of label indexing and nesting control.

(assert_invalid
  (module (func $deep-nested-label 
    (block (block (block (block (block (br 6)))))))

  "unknown label"
