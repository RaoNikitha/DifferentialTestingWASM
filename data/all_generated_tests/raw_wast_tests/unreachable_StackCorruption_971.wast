;; 2. **Test Description:**    A loop construct with an `unreachable` instruction inside the loop body, followed by stack manipulation. This tests if breaking out of the loop due to `unreachable` maintains stack integrity.    <br>**Constraint:** Ensure no stack overflow or underflow occurs due to the loop being interrupted by `unreachable`.
