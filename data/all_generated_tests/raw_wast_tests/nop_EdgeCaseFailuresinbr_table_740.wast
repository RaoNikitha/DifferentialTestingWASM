;; 1. **Test Description**: Include a `br_table` instruction with multiple indices and a `nop` instruction between each target manipulation to ensure the `nop` does not alter the indices handling for branching.    - **Constraint**: Verifying correct skipping over `nop` without any impact on control flow.    - **Edge Case**: Ensuring `br_table` handles out-of-bound indices correctly without interference from `nop`.
