;; 5. **Test 5: Return with Unwind During Exception**   Create scenarios where an exception is thrown in the called function, which is imported from another module. Verify if the return and stack unwinding are handled properly post-exception.   **Constraint**: Check whether `return` correctly unwinds the operand stack and maintains stack consistency even in the presence of exceptions.   **Relation to Incorrect Handling of Control Flow**: Ensures robust exception handling in stack management across module boundaries.
