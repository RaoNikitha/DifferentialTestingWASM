;; 3. **Test for Nested `nop` within `loop` Constructs**:    - **Description**: Place multiple `nop` instructions in nested `loop` constructs and check for operand type consistency after the loops.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures stack types and operand types remain unchanged across complex nested control flows.    - **Relation**: Verifies that `nop` within nested loops doesnâ€™t introduce unintended stack operations or type changes.
