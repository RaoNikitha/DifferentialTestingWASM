;; 4. **Test Name: No-Operation Following Indirect Function Call**    - **Description**: Insert a `nop` instruction immediately after a `call_indirect` instruction.    - **Constraint**: Ensure the callerâ€™s state remains unaffected by the inclusion of `nop`.    - **Improper Handling Check**: Evaluates if `nop` introduction disrupts post-call stack or control flow.    - **Expected Behavior**: Identical return behavior and stack state preservation across both implementations.
