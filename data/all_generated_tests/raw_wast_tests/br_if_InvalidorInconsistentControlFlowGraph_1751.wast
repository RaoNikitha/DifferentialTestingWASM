;; 2. **Test Description: Empty Operand Stack on Branch**    - **Reasoning**: The `br_if` instruction must find an `i32` operand and additional `[t*]` sequence on the stack when evaluating the condition.    - **Constraint Checked**: The presence of required operands on the stack.    - **Inconsistent CFG**: The CFG does not account for the stack state correctly leading to insufficient operands during the branch condition check.    - **Expected Differential Behavior**: The WASM code flags a generic invalid error, while the wizard_engine should report an `EmptyValueStackExpecting` error.
