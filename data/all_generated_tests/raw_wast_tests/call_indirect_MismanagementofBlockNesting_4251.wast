;; 10. **Test Description:**    Insert `call_indirect` within a nested `loop` that has an early exit condition (`br_if`) at a specific depth, which then calls a function indirectly, testing if prematurely exited nested loops correctly transition to the appropriate calling context.    - **Constraint Checked:** Early exits with nested loops in conjunction with `call_indirect`.    - **Mismanagement Relation:** Ensures that early exits don't cause confusion in control transitions within deeply nested loops.
