;; 5. **Loop with Conditional Exit (br_if) and Nop Instructions**:    - Construct a loop with complex conditions for `br_if` and embedded `nop` instructions. This checks if `wizard_engine` can handle initialization contexts correctly to prevent false infinite loops.    - Constraint: Conditions for exiting the loop must be met correctly irrespective of `nop`.
