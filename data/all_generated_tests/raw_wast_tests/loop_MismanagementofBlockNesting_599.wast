;; 10. **Nested Loop Depth Overflow Handling**:     - Test Description: Design a WebAssembly module with a high number of nesting levels, testing for overflow or incorrect branch target handling due to depth misinterpretations.     - Constraint: Ensure labels are correctly resolved without resulting in stack overflow or misrouted branches.     - Relation: This test probes extreme nesting cases and the systemâ€™s ability to maintain accurate label stacks and branch targets under deep nesting stress.
