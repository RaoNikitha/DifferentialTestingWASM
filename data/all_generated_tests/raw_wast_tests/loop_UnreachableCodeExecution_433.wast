;; 4. **Test Description**: Write a loop that re-declares a label in an inner scope with an invalid type, implicitly leading the outer loop to an `unreachable` instruction due to misconfigured branching.    - **Constraint**: Tests proper management and scoping of labels within nested loop structures.    - **Unreachable Code Execution**: Label conflicts should not cause paths to fall through to `unreachable`; correct label handling should trap or prevent execution deviation.
