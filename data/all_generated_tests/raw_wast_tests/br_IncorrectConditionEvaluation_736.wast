;; 7. **Test Description:**    - A `br_if` statement inside an `if` block where the condition is a comparison between two local variables set within a loop (ensuring one variable changes inside the loop).    - **Constraint Checked:** Accurate comparison evaluation under looping variable changes.    - **Test Relation:** Ensures branching decisions are correct when comparing dynamically changing values within loops.
