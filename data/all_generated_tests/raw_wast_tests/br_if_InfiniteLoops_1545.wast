;; 6. **Test Description**: Set up `br_if` in a loop where the label index is at the edge of valid bounds. This test will check if out-of-bound label access is handled properly.    - **Constraint Checked**: Out-of-bound label access checks.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Mismanagement of label bounds may lead to invalid jumps, thus trapping execution within a loop.
