;; 5. **Test: Invalid Type in Operand Stack for `br_if`**:    - **Description**: Test `br_if` execution when the stack contains operands of incorrect types relative to the expected types before the condition check.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures operand stack types match the expected types before `br_if`.    - **Relation to Incorrect Branch Target Resolution**: Prevents incorrect branch resolutions due to type mismatches, ensuring accurate control flow.
