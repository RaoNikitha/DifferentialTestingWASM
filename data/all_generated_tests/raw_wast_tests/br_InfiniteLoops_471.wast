;; 2. **Test Description**: Implement a loop that contains both `br` and `br_if` instructions, with `br_if` being dependent on a condition to exit the loop. The `br` always jumps back to the start. Ensure the condition for `br_if` is met eventually to exit the loop.    **Constraint**: Tests operational correctness of operand handling and control flow.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Incorrect operand stack management or control flow can cause `br_if` not to exit the loop, causing an infinite loop.
