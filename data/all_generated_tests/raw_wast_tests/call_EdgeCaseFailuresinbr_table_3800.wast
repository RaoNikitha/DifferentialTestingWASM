;; 9. **Test: Multiple Br_Table Redirects to Single Target**    - **Description**: Design a `br_table` with all indices redirecting to a single target, followed by complex `call` chains.    - **Constraint**: Ensure the stack conditions are the same regardless of the `br_table` index, consistent with subsequent `call` operations.    - **Edge Case**: Validates handling uniform redirections to single control paths, confirming stack state reliability for multiple calls.
