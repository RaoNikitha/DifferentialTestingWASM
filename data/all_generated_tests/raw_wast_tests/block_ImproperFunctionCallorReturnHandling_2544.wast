;; 5. **Function Call Followed by Branch Out of Block:**    - **Test Description:** Implement a function call within a block that is directly followed by a branch (`br`) targeting an outer block.    - **Constraint Checked:** Accurate management of control flow and label indexing for branching after a function call.    - **Relation to Improper Function Handling:** Verify control flow integrity when branching occurs immediately after a function call in a block.
