;; 10. **Test 10: Loop with `nop` and Invalid Condition**:     - **Description**: A loop with intentionally invalid conditions meant to exit the loop, testing robustness against `nop` instructions.     - **Constraint**: Ensures `nop` does not affect error handling or loop control logic.     - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Validates that such conditions (combined with `nop`) are handled gracefully without leading to infinite loops.     - **Example**: `(loop $L (nop) (br_if $L (i32.eqz (i32.const 0))) (unreachable))`
