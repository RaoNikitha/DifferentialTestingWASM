;; 2. **`nop` in Nested Control Structures**:    - Place `nop` instructions within nested `block`, `loop`, and `if` structures. Validate if the implementations can handle deeply nested yet functionally empty control flow with `nop`.    - Constraint: Examines the CFGâ€™s ability to maintain structural integrity without influencing nesting levels.
