;; 5. **Test Description:**    - A `br` instruction targeting a forward label, followed by an `unreachable` instruction, to see if incorrect stack management causes `unreachable` to be hit.    - **Constraint: Correct Operand Handling**    - **Differential Behavior: The Wizard Engine's detailed operand stack management should prevent this while WebAssembly could mishandle the stack and meet `unreachable`.**
