;; 6. **Test Description:** Create a `block` with a large sequence of `nop` instructions followed by an unrelated instruction without a proper `end` to test instruction context handling.     - **Constraint Checked:** Validates context extension and instruction sequence handling within the block.     - **Infinite Loop Relation:** Lack of proper `end` might cause the execution flow to misinterpret instructions, potentially looping indefinitely.
