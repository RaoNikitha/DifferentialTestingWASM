;; 10. **Mixed Branching and Function Calls**:     - Description: Integrate function calls within a loop that includes multiple branches. The functions should contain their branching logic. Verify that branches outside and inside functions resolve correctly to their intended loop targets.     - Reasoning: Tests interaction between function calls and loop branching to ensure correct control flow across functions and loops.
