;; 7. **Test7: Forward vs Backward Branch Misalignment**    - **Description:** Use a `br_table` to toggle between forward and backward branches with mismatched operand stack expectations.    - **Stack Corruption Check:** Determine if switching between these branches results in stack overflow, underflow, or mismanagement.
