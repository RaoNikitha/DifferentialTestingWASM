;; 5.  *Test Description*: Check if a forward branch in an exported function, that resumes execution after an `end` instruction, maintains proper stack state when the block crosses module boundaries.     *Constraint Being Checked*: Ensures that the forward branch handling correctly restores the operand stack and continues proper execution flow post `end` across module boundaries.
