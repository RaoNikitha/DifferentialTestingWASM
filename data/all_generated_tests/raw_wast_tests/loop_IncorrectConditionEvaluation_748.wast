;; 9. **Test Description**: Design a loop with a `br_if` based on the result of a complex mathematical function (e.g., factorial, logarithmic). Verify the loop exits correctly according to the precise function result.    - **Constraint**: Validate complete and precise evaluation of complex conditions for correct branching.    - **Incorrect Condition Evaluation**: Checks if complex condition evaluations in `br_if` lead to unintended results.
