;; 10. **Type Mismatch in Block Return Types**:    - Create an `if` block with return instructions that have mismatched types for the block return type, verifying CFG handling of incorrect return type propagation.    - *Constraint*: Ensuring the block return types are validated and matched correctly as per function signature.    - *Relation to CFG*: Tests CFGâ€™s management and validation of return types for control flow integrity.
