;; 4. **Test Description**:     Create a series of `call` instructions to different WebAssembly functions, ensuring `nop` instructions are placed immediately before and after each call. Verify the stack's state remains correct and uncorrupted.    **Constraint**: `nop` must not impact function call stack operations.    **Reasoning**: Checks if `nop` affects stack frames for `call` instructions, leading to potential stack corruption.
