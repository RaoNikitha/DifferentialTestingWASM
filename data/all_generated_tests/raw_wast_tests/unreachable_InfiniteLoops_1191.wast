;; 2. **Test 2:** Place `unreachable` inside a loop but after a `br_if` to check if the loop terminates based on the condition before reaching `unreachable`.    - **Constraint:** Validate that conditional branching works and allows the trap to occur.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops:** Ensures conditional exit prevents infinite loop despite an `unreachable` statement.
