;; 3. **Test Description**: A loop that uses `br_if` with multiple conditions combined using logical AND and OR operations to decide whether to break.    - **Constraint**: Ensures combined logical conditions in `br_if` are correctly evaluated to decide the branch direction.    - **Differential Behavior**: The loop either exits too early or continues despite the complex combined condition being true to break.
