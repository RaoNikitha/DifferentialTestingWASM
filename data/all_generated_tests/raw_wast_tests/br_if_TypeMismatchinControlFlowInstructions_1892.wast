;; 3. **Branching with Insufficient Operands**:    - **Description**: Implement a `br_if` instruction that attempts to branch to a block that requires two operand types `[i32, i32]` but only one operand `[i32]` is on the stack.    - **Constraint**: Verifies stack height and operand validation during a branch.    - **Differential Behavior**: WASM will detect the insufficient operands error, wizard_engine may not correctly manage the stack references.
