;; 6. **Mismatched Types in Conditional Branches**:    - Use `if` branches with differing types in `then` and `else` blocks, violating the requirement for them to produce the same type of output values.    - *Constraint*: Ensuring both branches produce consistent types as specified by block type.    - *Relation to CFG*: Checks CFGâ€™s handling and type consistency across branches.
