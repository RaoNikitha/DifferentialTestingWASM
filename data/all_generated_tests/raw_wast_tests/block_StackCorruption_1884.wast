;; 5. **Invalid Operand Types within Block**:    - Description: Provide operands of incorrect types within a block, mismatched against the expected `valtype?` of the blocktype.    - Constraint: Block type validation against operand types.    - Reasoning: Mistreatment of operand types might cause stack mismatches, resulting in stack corruption when executing type-sensitive instructions.
