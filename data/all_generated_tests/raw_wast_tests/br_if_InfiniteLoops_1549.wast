;; 10. **Test Description**: A scenario where a loop consists of a conditional `if` block with a nested `br_if` targeting various levels of the enclosing loops. Ensure correct unwinding consistency between `if` and loop blocks.    - **Constraint Checked**: Interaction of `if` blocks and loop-control instructions.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Incorrect interaction between `if` conditions and loop exits could cause the loop to function infinitely without breaking as intended.
