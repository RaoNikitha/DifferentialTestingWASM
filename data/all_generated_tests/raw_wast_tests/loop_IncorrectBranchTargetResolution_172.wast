;; 3. **Indirect Branch in Loop Table**:    - Description: Use a `br_table` instruction within a loop to branch to multiple potential targets, including the loop itself. The table must index correctly to ensure branches jump to the intended targets.    - Reasoning: Checks the correct resolution of indirect branches in a loop and ensures the proper label is targeted.
