;; 2. **Test Description**: Implement a `br_table` within a nested control structure where the index falls precisely on the boundary of the table's size. The test should ensure correct branch targets.    - **Constraint**: Ensures the boundary condition is correctly managed and the branch targets to the last defined valid label.    - **Edge Case Relation**: Tests the implementationâ€™s handling of indices that exactly match table bounds, checking if it branches appropriately.
