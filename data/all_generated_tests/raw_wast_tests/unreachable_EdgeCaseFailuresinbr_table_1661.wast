;; 2. **Test Case 2:** Create a `br_table` instruction with a varying number of labels, placing `unreachable` both before and after the table to verify if the trap affects the jumping behavior appropriately. \    _Constraint Checked: Correct trapping mechanism and consistent branch execution stopping._
