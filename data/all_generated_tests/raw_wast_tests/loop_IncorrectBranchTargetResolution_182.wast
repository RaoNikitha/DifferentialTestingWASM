;; 3. **`br_table` with Incorrect Label Resolution**:    - **Description**: Test a `br_table` instruction within a loop having multiple nested blocks and loops, where the `br_table` mislabels and branches to an unintended target due to incorrect label resolution.    - **Constraint**: Correct fall-through to the default target when the operand is out of bounds; accurate branching based on label entries.
