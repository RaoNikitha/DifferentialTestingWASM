;; 10. **Randomized Target Indices**:     - Prepare a `br_table` with random indices generated at runtime and a broad range of targets.     - **Constraint**: Test the robustness of handling random, dynamic indices.     - **Edge Case**: Observes if dynamic elements cause any inconsistency in execution.  Each description addresses a unique edge case around `br_table`'s handling of indices and branching, specifically crafted to identify differential behaviors due to varying implementations of the `return` instruction between WebAssembly and the Wizard Engine.
