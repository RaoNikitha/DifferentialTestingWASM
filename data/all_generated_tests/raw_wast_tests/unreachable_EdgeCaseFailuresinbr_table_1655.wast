;; 6. **Test 6: Br_table with Conditional Unreachable Target**    - A `br_table` where one conditional path leads to `unreachable`, intended to test boundary conditions.    - **Reasoning:** Tests if conditional paths leading to `unreachable` trap accurately.    - **Constraint:** Evaluates how conditional execution paths are managed when reaching `unreachable`.
