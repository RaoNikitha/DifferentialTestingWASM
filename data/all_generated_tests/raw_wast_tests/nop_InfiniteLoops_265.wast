;; 6. **Test Description: Position `nop` within an infinite loop that contains a series of complex control instructions (`loop`, `if`, etc.).**    - **Reasoning**: Verify that `nop` is ignored and does not affect the control flow.    - **Check**: The loop should only follow the other control instructions without alteration.
