;; 6. **Test Description:**     A `br_table` instruction with its index controlled by a non-integer stack value (e.g., float) that falls out of bounds, immediately followed by `unreachable` intended to detect type mismatches leading to traps.    **Constraint Checked:** Validates handling of type conversion issues and out-of-bounds indices leading to traps.    **Edge Case Relation:** Ensures non-integer indices in `br_table` lead to consistent traps.
