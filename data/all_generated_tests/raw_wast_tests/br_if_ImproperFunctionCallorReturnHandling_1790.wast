;; 1. **Test Description**:    - **Test Name**: Conditional Branch Before Function Call    - **Description**: Test a `br_if` instruction immediately before a function call to ensure proper stack unwinding and operand checking. The `br_if` should conditionally bypass the function call based on a stack operand.     - **Constraint Check**: Confirms that the correct function is called or skipped based on the branch condition.    - **Improper Handling**: Ensures that incorrect branching does not lead to skipping or incorrectly invoking a function.
