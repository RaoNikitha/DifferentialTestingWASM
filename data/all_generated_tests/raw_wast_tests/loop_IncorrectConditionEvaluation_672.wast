;; 3. **Test Description 3**:    - **Test**: Loop with a `br_if` condition based on a comparison between a local variable and a constant.    - **Constraint**: Verify that the loop exits correctly when the variable fails to meet the condition.    - **Reason**: Faulty condition checks might make the loop continue incorrectly.
