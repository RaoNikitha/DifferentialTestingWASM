;; 10. **Test Ten**:     - `br_table` with a direct jump to a non-existent index after a sequence of valid jumps, all wrapped in a loop that has its own branching logic.     - **Constraint**: Ensures that once an invalid index is hit, the loop's own branching logic is still validated correctly.     - **Relation**: Combines index validation with overall loop block handling and ensures continued correct state management.
