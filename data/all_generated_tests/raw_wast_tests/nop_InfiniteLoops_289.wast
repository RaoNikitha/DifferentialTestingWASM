;; 10. **Test with `loop` containing a series of `nop` and nested `br_table` control checks**:    - **Constraint**: Ensures complex nested control structures with `nop` do not disrupt flow.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Mismanagement in `nop` could lead to improper table jumps leading to infinite iterations within the loop.
