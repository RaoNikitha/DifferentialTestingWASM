;; 7. **Test Description**: Develop a loop containing a sequence of `br_if` instructions, each with different but legitimate conditions, and validate the sequential label indexing.    - **Constraint Checked**: Consecutive `br_if` execution within label constraints.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Faulty label indexing in consecutive `br_if` may cause the loop never to reach its termination condition.
