;; 1. **Test Description:** Verify that when an out-of-bounds operand is provided to the `br_table` instruction, the execution should jump to the default label, ensuring the default label is resolved correctly.    - **Constraint Checked:** Ensures that the default label is correctly used when the operand exceeds the label vector length.    - **Relation to Incorrect Branch Target Resolution:** Incorrect resolution could cause the branch to an invalid or unintended target.
