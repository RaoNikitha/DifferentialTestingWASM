;; 3. **Test 3: Loop Inside a Block**    - **Description:** A block contains a loop, and within the loop, there's a `br_if` targeting the outermost block.    - **Constraint Checked:** Proper type transformation and stack unwinding when a loop is nested within a block.    - **Mismanagement Relation:** Ensuring the loop correctly identifies the outer block label when using `br_if`.
