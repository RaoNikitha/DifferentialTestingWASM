;; 8. **Test: Operand Stack Underflow with MisPushed Operands**    - Description: Induce an error by mismanaging the operand stack such that an `call_indirect` instruction lacks necessary arguments by deliberately removing or failing to push. Expect this scenario to execute `unreachable`.    - Constraint: Operand stack underflow triggers failure.    - Unreachable Execution: Improper stack management leads to unintended `unreachable` execution.
