;; 1. **Empty Loop with Inconsistent Branch**:    Create a loop block that is empty but contains a branch (`br 0`) targeting its label, which should be valid but not execute any instructions.    Constraint: Ensure proper handling of empty instruction sequences and corresponding branches.    Expected: Correct unwinding and branch recognition should result in exiting the loop without error.
