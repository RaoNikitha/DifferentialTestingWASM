;; 7. **`br_if` in a Loop:**    - A `br_if` placed inside a loop with varying condition values. Verify if the branch correctly takes or skips according to the condition on each iteration.    - Constraint Checked: Conditional evaluation within loops.    - Relation: Tests dynamic condition evaluation in iterative contexts.
