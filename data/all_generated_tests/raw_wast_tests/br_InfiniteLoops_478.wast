;; 9. **Test Description**: Set up a `loop` with multiple `if-else` structures inside and respective `br` instructions. The loop must exit upon satisfying certain conditions evaluated by a `br_if`. Ensure nested conditions are met to exit cleanly.    **Constraint**: Checks correct nesting constraints and stack polymorphism handling.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Improper nesting or stack handling can cause conditions never to be met correctly, keeping the loop running indefinitely.
