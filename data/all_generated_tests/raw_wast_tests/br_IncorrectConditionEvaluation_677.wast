;; 8. **Test 8: Incorrect Condition Evaluation by Stack Polymorphism**    - Create a `br_if` condition with multiple stack operations (push and pop) performed before evaluating the condition instruction. Validate correct stack management and condition evaluation.    - **Constraint Checked**: Polymorphic behavior of the stack during condition evaluation.
