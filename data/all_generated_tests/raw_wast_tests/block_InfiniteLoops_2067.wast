;; 8. **Test Description:** Use a `block` with an immediate branching to `loop`, where the loop condition is always false due to incorrect block stack management.     - **Constraint Checked:** Verifies correct management of block stack and handling of immediate branches.     - **Infinite Loop Relation:** Mismanagement can cause failure to exit `loop`, resulting in an infinite loop.
