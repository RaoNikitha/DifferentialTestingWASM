;; 6. **Test Case: Inter-block Result Handling**    - **Test Description**: Use nested blocks to produce intermediate results with operations like `add` or `mul` and `br` statements to test if results are correctly transferred between blocks.    - **Constraint**: Confirms that results from one block are accurately carried over when branches are taken to outer blocks.    - **Relation to Mismanagement**: Incorrect handling of block results and stack transference would lead to computation errors and inconsistencies.
