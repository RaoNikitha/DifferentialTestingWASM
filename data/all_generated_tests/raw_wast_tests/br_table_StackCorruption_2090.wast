;; 10. **Test10: Unexpected Operand Types Post Branching**     - **Description:** After a `br_table` branch, expect specific operand types on the stack and perform operations confirming their integrity.     - **Stack Corruption Check:** Detect incorrect operand types post-branching that indicate stack corruption or type mismatches resulting from the branching logic.
