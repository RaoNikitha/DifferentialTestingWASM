;; 1. **Test Description:**    - Create a WebAssembly module with an `unreachable` instruction inside an `if` condition that relies on a false condition (e.g., 0). Check if the engine traps immediately without continuing to the false branch instructions.    - Constraint: Tests condition evaluation in branching and immediate trapping by `unreachable`.    - Relation to Incorrect Condition Evaluation: Ensures `unreachable` within a false path does not erroneously execute due to positional tracking issues.
