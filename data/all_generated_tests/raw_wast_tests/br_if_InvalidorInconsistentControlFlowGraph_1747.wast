;; 8. **Test Description: Misaligned Branch Indices Leading to Incorrect Control Flow**    - Implement a control flow where `br_if` uses incorrect branch indices, leading to branches that do not align with the control flow graphâ€™s path.    - **Constraint Check**: Validate that branch indices correctly map to their intended labels.    - **CFG Relevance**: Ensures alignment of branch indices with CFG paths.
