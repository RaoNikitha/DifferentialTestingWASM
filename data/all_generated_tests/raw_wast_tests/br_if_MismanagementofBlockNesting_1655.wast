;; 6. **Test Description**: Encapsulate an `if` within a loop and place a `br_if` targeting the loop within the `if`'s false path. Ensure that a false `br_if` results in a no-op and the control flow continues correctly within the `if`.    - **Constraint Checked**: Accurate label targeting and stack state for no-op scenario in nested conditions.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: Incorrect handling might cause an unintended exit from the `if` or loop.
