;; 2. **Test Description:**    - Define a `loop` with an input type `f64`.    - Within the loop, use a `br` instruction aiming to jump back to the loopâ€™s beginning but with an `i32` value on the stack instead.    - This tests the handling of mismatched operand types for backward branches to loops.
