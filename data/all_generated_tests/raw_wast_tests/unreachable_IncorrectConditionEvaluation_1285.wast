;; - **Test 6: Mixed Type Stack Manipulation and Conditional Branching**   ```   Use a complex sequence involving stack manipulations (e.g., `i32.const`, `i64.const`) followed by `br_if` and `unreachable`. Ensure condition evaluations correctly lead to the trap. Mis-evaluation of conditions due to stack operations could highlight differential behavior.   ``` -
