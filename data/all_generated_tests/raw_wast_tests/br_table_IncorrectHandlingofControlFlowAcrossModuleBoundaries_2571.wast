;; 10. **Unaligned Operand Stack after Cross-Module Call:**    - Sequence calls to exported functions followed by `br_table`, ensuring the operand stack alignment mismatches expected types.    - **Constraint Checked:** Ensures the operand stack does not get corrupted after control flow transitions from exported function calls followed by `br_table`.    - **Reasoning:** Tests how well `br_table` maintains stack integrity and type consistency through control flow changes involving exports.
