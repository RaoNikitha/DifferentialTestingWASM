;; 7. Design a structure where a `loop` is nested inside a `block`, and place a `br` instruction in the `loop` to break to the outer block. Verify correct control flow transition after the outer blockâ€™s `end`. This tests the ability to handle `br` instruction when nested structures include loops.
