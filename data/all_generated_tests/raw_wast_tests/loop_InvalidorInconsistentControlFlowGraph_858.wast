;; 9. **Multiple Independent Loops Interaction**:    - **Description**: Create multiple independent loops within a function, with branches attempting to target other loop instances incorrectly.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensuring each loopâ€™s label scope is respected and branches do not cross between independent loops.    - **CFG Relevance**: Verifies the CFG distinctly separates and manages independent loop scopes correctly.
