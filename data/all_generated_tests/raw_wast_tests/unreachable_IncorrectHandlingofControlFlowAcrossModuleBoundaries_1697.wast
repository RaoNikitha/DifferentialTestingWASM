;; 8. **Import Function with `unreachable` in Loop and Exported from Caller:**    - Build a module importing a function that contains a loop, and at some point in the loop, an `unreachable` instruction is executed. The importing module then exports its function, which calls this loop.    - **Constraint:** Affirms whether the exporting module handles the trap from `unreachable` correctly during looping operations.
