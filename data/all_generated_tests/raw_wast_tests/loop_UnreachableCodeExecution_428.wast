;; 9. **Test Description 9**: Design a loop with a `br_if` instruction targeting an inner loop label but include a mispredicted `br_if` condition being false, propelling the execution to skip into an enclosing `unreachable`. Validate if mispredictions in branching propagate leading to `unreachable`.
