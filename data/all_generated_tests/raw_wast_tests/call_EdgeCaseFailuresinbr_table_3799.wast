;; 8. **Test: Edge Case with Br_Table Directing to Non-Function Targets**    - **Description**: Include a `br_table` that could redirect to non-function targets (like blocks or loops) followed by a `call` that expects specific stack states.    - **Constraint**: Verify non-function target handling doesnâ€™t disrupt stack for following `call`.    - **Edge Case**: Checks non-standard control flow and its impact on stack setup for `call` operations.
