;; 10. **Test Description**: Develop a sequence of loops with different loop depths, each having a `br` targeting the next outer loop level correctly and an `if` statement with `br_if` for loop termination. Ensure structured control flow enforcements.    **Constraint**: Verifies structured control flow is maintained.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Violations in structured control flow may result in loops not terminating as intended, causing infinite loops.
