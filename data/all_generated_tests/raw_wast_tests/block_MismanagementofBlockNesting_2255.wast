;; 6. **Test Description**: Construct a block containing a `loop` and within it another block with a `br` instruction aimed at both loop and outer block levels. Verify that each level's flow control is appropriately executed.    - **Constraint**: Validate nested block and loop with cross-nested branches.    - **Nesting Mismanagement Check**: Ensures nested branches target correct block or loop within the nesting stack.
