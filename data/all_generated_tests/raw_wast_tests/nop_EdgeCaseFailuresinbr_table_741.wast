;; 2. **Test Description**: Create a `br_table` with indices that target labels interleaved with `nop` instructions randomly placed before each label.    - **Constraint**: Confirming `nop`'s presence does not affect the branching to correct labels.    - **Edge Case**: Checking correct label targeting when `br_table` index exceeds bounds.
