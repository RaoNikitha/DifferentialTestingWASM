;; 10. **Test 10: Forward Branch with Incorrect Operand Type**    - **Description**: Construct a loop where `br_table` intends a forward branch but the operand stack types do not match the target. Include conditions to re-enter the loop.    - **Constraint**: Ensures forward branching operand type matches are handled well.    - **Infinite Loop Relation**: The mismatch in operand types for forward branching can fail to exit the loop appropriately, creating infinite looping conditions.
