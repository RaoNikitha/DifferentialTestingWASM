;; 1. **Test for Inner `if` Block Resolution Error**:    Create a nested `if` block within another `if` statement, both having the same label names/categories. Validate the resolution of the inner `if` block to correctly jump to its corresponding `else` and `end`.    - **Constraint**: Ensure the inner `if` block label does not interfere with the outer blockâ€™s label resolution.    - **Expectation**: Inner `if` should resolve its branches correctly internally.
