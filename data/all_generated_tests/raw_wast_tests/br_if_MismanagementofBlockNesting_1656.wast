;; 7. **Test Description**: Use multiple nested `block` constructs with a `br_if` instruction conditionally targeting the second innermost block. Check if the control flow and operand stack are correctly managed upon taking the branch.    - **Constraint Checked**: Precise index handling for intermediate block targeting.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: Mismanagement can lead to exiting the wrong block or malformed stack after branch.
