;; 4. **Test Description**: Embed a `br_if` in a block sequence within a `loop` such that the `br_if` conditionally breaks to the loopâ€™s start. Use `br_table` to index targets ambiguously related to the loop. Validate if `wizard_engine` correctly resolves label arguments, while WASM misinterprets targets.
