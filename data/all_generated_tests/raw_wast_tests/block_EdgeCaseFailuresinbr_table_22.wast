;; 3. Test with nested `block` instructions, each containing `br_table` with varying valid and invalid indices:    - Two nested `blocks` each containing a `br_table`, with one block target index being out of range.    - Specific Constraint: Ensures proper context and stack management in nested scopes.    - Edge Case: Validates the outer and inner blocksâ€™ handling of out-of-bounds and in-bounds indices correctly.
