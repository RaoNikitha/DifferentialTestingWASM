;; 7. **Test Description**: Create a loop with a `br_if` instruction contingent on multiple-bit-wise checks (AND/OR operations). Verify proper loop execution and termination.    - **Constraint**: Validate compound condition evaluations in the `br_if` instruction for correct execution and termination of the loop.    - **Incorrect Condition Evaluation**: Misinterpretation in handling compound conditions in branch evaluations is tested here.
