;; 2. **Branch Out of Loop:**    - Test Condition: Implement an `if` instruction within a loop with a `br_if` that attempts to exit the loop under a constant false condition.    - Constraint: The `br_if` should not exit the loop, validating branches and stack management.    - Relevance: Assesses handling infinite loops when `br_if` fails to exit as intended.
