;; 5. **Test for Unreachable Code:**    - **Description**: A control structure followed by a `br` instruction that skips over subsequent code sections, testing for proper marking of unreachable code.    - **Constraint Checked**: Properly setting code as unreachable post `br`.    - **Relation to CFG**: Ensures proper marking of unreachable code segments in CFG.
