;; 6. **Test 6: Loop with Test-and-Increment Logic and `nop`**:    - **Description**: A loop that uses test-and-increment logic to exit after a certain count, interspersed with `nop` instructions.    - **Constraint**: Ensures `nop` does not affect the loop counter or exit condition.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Verifies that the presence of `nop` doesnâ€™t cause infinite looping by hindering loop increment/decrement.    - **Example**: `(loop $L (nop) (local.set 0 (i32.add (local.get 0) (i32.const 1))) (br_if $L (i32.lt_s (local.get 0) (i32.const 10))))`
