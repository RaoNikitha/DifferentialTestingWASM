;; 10. **Test 10: Interleaved Blocks and Branch Chains**     - **Description:** Multiple interleaving block sequences with `br` and `br_table` instructions targeting different levels of nesting and producing varied stack results.     - **Constraint:** Checks the correct mapping and handling of interleaved block structures.     - **Mismanagement Check:** Ensures the correct interleaving control flow and correct stack adjustments between interleaved nested blocks.
