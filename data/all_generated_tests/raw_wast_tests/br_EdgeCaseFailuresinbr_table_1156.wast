;; 7. **Test Description**: A `br_table` with mixed valid and out-of-bounds target labels, and an index that oscillates between valid and invalid values during execution.    - **Constraint Checked**: Consistent and correct behavior when alternating between valid and invalid indices.    - **Edge Case Relation**: Ensures robust performance with dynamic index values that straddle the line between valid and invalid ranges.
