;; 9. **Test Description**: Construct a `br_table` test case where index computations are dynamically produced and ensure they stay within valid ranges but stress the boundary conditions. This ensures correct handling of dynamically generated indices.    - **Constraint**: Dynamically compute indices that are within and near the boundary limits.    - **Edge Case Relation**: Validates robustness in handling dynamically computed indices near boundaries.
