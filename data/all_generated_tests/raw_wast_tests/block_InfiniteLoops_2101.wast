;; Test 2: Implement a nested block structure where the inner block contains a loop that should exit on an `i32.eqz` condition but doesnâ€™t due to incorrect stack handling. The outer block type requires an `i32` result. Verify if WebAssembly manages the nested block correctly and exits, while `wizard_engine` gets stuck in an infinite loop.
