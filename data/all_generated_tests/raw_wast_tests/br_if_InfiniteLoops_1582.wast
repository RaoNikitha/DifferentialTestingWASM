;; 3. **Test Description**:     - Deploy a loop where `br_if` targets a block outside and the condition is always true. The loop should exit correctly.    - **Constraint Checking**: Ensures exit criteria are correctly handled by identifying the block results for non-loop targets.    - **Infinite Loop Relation**: To verify the exit does not trap the program in an infinite loop, demonstrating accurate differentiation for non-loops in `wizard_engine`.
