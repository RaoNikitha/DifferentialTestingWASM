;; 9. **Unreachable Loop Code**:    Insert a sequence within a loop that includes an unreachable instruction followed by a conditional branch intended to be evaluated.    Constraint: Ensure that unreachable code is properly handled and does not interfere with subsequent branches.    Expected: Identification and handling of unreachable instructions should prevent CFG inconsistencies.
