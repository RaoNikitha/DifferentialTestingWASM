;; 3. **Test 3**:    - **Description**: Construct a loop with conditional branching based on stack-top values. These values are generated by previous loop iterations.    - **Constraint**: Validity of conditional branch instructions checking stack-top values.    - **Stack Corruption Check**: Ensure no stack corruption when re-reading the top values after several iterations.
