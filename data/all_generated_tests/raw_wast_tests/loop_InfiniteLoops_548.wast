;; 9. **Test Description**: Configure a loop that has a conditional `br_if` with operand consumption leading to condition always being `true`, ensuring loop body never exits.    **Constraint Checked**: Operand stack management during condition evaluation.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Validates operand handling so that an infinite loop doesn't occur due to continual `true` conditions from stack mismanagement.
