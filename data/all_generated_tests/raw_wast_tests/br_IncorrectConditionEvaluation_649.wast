;; 10. **`br_if` Combination with `br`:**     - A `br_if` followed by an unconditional `br`. Ensure the `br_if` correctly evaluates the condition and the unconditional `br` is honored regardless.     - Constraint Checked: Interaction between conditional and unconditional branches.     - Relation: Tests clarity in distinguishing between conditional and unconditional instructions.
