;; 7. **Test Name: No-Operation in Recursive Function Calls**    - **Description**: Add `nop` instructions within a recursive function.    - **Constraint**: Confirm that the recursion and its base cases are unaffected by `nop`.    - **Improper Handling Check**: Ensures `nop` does not interfere with recursive calls and stack states.    - **Expected Behavior**: Identical behavior in recursion depth handling and return sequences.
