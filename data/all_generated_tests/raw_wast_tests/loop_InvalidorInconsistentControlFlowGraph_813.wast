;; 4. **Branch to Nonexistent Label**:    Include a `br` instruction within a loop that targets a label index that does not exist, forcing the validation to check for accurate label indexing.    Constraint: Ensure the branch targets valid label indices within the loop context.    Expected: Detection of invalid label index leading to an error, indicating malformed loop structure.
