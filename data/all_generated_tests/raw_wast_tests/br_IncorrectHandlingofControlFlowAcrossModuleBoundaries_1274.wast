;; 5. **Test with Conditional Branches and Imports:**    - Use conditional branching (`if` condition) along with `br` instructions in a function within module A and call imported functions from module B in the branches. The aim is to ensure stack integrity and proper branching behavior when control crosses module boundaries conditionally.    - **Constraint Checked:** Correct label indexing and stack management in conditional branches with cross-module calls.    - **Relation to Constraint:** Ensures conditional branch instructions correctly interact with imported functions across module boundaries.
