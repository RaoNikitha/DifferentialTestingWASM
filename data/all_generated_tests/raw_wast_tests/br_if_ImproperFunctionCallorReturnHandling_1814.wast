;; 5. **Test Description:** Call a function within an `if` block with `br_if` to validate that control flow correctly respects the `if` condition when breaking out to the surrounding function.    - **Constraint:** Ensures the correct handling of `if` conditions and breakouts.    - **Improper Handling:** The branch incorrectly evaluated or the function call improperly placed.
