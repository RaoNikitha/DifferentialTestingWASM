;; 8. **Test: Conditional Branch to Loop with Empty Stack**:    - **Description**: Test `br_if` targeting a loop start with an empty operand stack.    - **Constraint Checked**: Validates that branching to a loop start requires the right number of operands on the stack.    - **Relation to Incorrect Branch Target Resolution**: Prevents incorrect loop entry due to stack underflows, ensuring correct iterative control flow.
