;; 1. **Test Description:**    Validate a scenario where a `br_if` instruction is used within a nested `block`, with the condition designed to evaluate to `true`. Verify that the outer `block` is exited correctly when the condition is met.    - **Constraint Checked:** Correct evaluation of `br_if` condition within nested blocks.    - **Relation to Incorrect Condition Evaluation:** Ensures that the condition check doesnâ€™t incorrectly skip the branch when the condition is `true`.
