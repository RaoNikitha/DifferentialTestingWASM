;; 6. **Conditional Branch Misalignment**:    Implement a `br_if` instruction that conditionally branches to a label within the loop, but the condition's evaluation leads to an inconsistent CFG state.    Constraint: Ensure conditional branches are correctly evaluated and applied, preserving CFG validity.    Expected: Proper checking should maintain CFG integrity and prevent misaligned branches.
