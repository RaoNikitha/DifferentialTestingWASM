;; 9. **Test Case 9**:    - **Description**: Develop a module with a series of nested label definitions where `call_indirect` is executed. Use a mix of loops and conditional exits, with `br` targeting intermediate labels ensuring correct depth resolution for targeting the correct function.    - **Constraint Checked**: Accurate midpoint resolution in branching.    - **Incorrect Branch Target Resolution**: Confirms that `br` instruction intellect resolves nested intermediate labels accurately for correct intermediate function calling.
