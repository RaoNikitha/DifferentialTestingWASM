;; 6. **Test Description:**    A block containing a loop where a `br` instruction is used to branch out but has the wrong label, causing unintended infinite execution.      **Constraint Checked:** Label indexing and correctness of branch targets.      **Relation to Infinite Loops:** Checks if branch instructions properly handle label indexing, ensuring intended loop exits.
