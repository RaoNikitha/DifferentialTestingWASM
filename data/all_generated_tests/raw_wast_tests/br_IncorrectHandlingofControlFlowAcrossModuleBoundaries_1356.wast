;; 7. **Test Description:**    - **Test Name:** Return with Branch to Export Function Test    - **Objective:** Verify correct execution of `br` instruction while returning from an import and immediately branching in an export function.    - **Constraint:** Tests transition and operand stack management during combined import/export operations with branches.    - **Relation to Incorrect Handling:** Ensures smooth control flow transitions and operations across function exportation boundaries.
