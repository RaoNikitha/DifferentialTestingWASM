;; 6. **Test Case 6: Function calls within a `nop` sandwiched structure eventually leading to `unreachable`:**    - **Constraint Checked:** `nop`'s presence should not affect function calls and their return to main execution flow.    - **Expected Behavior:** After function returns, should hit `unreachable` and trap.    - **Differential Behavior:** Mismanagement in wizard_engine within function contexts could lead to unexpected results.
