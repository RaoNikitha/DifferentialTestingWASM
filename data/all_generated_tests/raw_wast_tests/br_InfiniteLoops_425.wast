;; 6. **Test Description:**    - Create a loop with a nested `if` block having a `br` that always jumps to the loop’s beginning under specific conditions, ensuring these conditions are met frequently during execution.    - **Constraint:** To test differential behavior in label indexing and stack unwinding, checking the engine’s processing of loop entry and exit points without causing an infinite loop.
