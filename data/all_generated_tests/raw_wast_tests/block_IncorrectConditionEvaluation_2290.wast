;; **Differential Test Descriptions:**  1. Create a `block` with a `blocktype` that has a specific result type and an instruction sequence containing `br_if` that should only branch if the top stack value is non-zero. Place a `0` on the stack before `br_if`. Verify if branching does not occur incorrectly.
