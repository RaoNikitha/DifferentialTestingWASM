;; 9. **Test 9: Tail Call Optimization Fails**   Create a scenario where a tail call optimization impacts the return behavior across module boundaries. Check if tail call optimization is equally effective and consistent in both engines.   **Constraint**: Ensure tail call optimizations don't disrupt stack consistency for subsequent returns.   **Relation to Incorrect Handling of Control Flow**: Ensures optimizations donâ€™t result in different outcomes across module calls.
