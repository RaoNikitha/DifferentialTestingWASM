;; 6. **Test 6**:    - Test proper function type conformity by calling a function indirectly that has looped instructions, with the included `typeidx` mismatching the called function's type. The loop contains misconfigured `br` instructions leading to potential infinite loop conditions.    - **Constraint Checked**: Checks type matching of function calls and evaluates loop control flow handling in mismatched type scenarios.
