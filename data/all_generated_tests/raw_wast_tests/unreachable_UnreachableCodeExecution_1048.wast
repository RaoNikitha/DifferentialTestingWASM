;; 9. **Unreachable with Complex Control Flow:**    - **Description:** Integrate `unreachable` within a complex combination of blocks, loops, and conditional branches to ensure it correctly causes a trap without being bypassed.    - **Constraint:** Verifies complex flow handling.    - **Relation to Unreachable Code Execution:** Tests the robustness of control flow management reaching `unreachable`.
