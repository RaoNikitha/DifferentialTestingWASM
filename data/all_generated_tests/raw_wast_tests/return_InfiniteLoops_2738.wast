;; 7. **Conditional `br_if` and Stack-Pushed Return Conditions**:    Implement a function where the loop conditionally pushes values onto the stack based on a `br_if` evaluation, and then perform a `return`. This highlights possible issues where incorrect stack management on conditional branches can cause improper execution of `return`, leading to infinite loops.
