;; 7. **Test Description**:    - Create a sequence of `if`, `else`, and `end` instructions interspersed with `nop` and validate stack behavior before and after conditional branches.    - **Constraint Checked**: Consistent stack states and correct condition evaluations around `nop`.    - **Relation to CFG**: Tests CFG's conditional branching pathways ensuring `nop` does not disrupt path execution.
