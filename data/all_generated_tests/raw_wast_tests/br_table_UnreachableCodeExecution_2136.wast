;; 6. **Test with Mismatched Operand Types:**    - Description: Create a `br_table` where the operand types do not match those expected by the target blockâ€™s configuration.    - Constraint Checked: Operand type matching between `br_table` and target block.    - Relates to Unreachable Code Execution: Mismatched operand types can cause unexpected behavior, resulting in an `unreachable` instruction being hit.
