;; 1. **Test Description**: Perform a `call_indirect` with a function type that exactly matches the type in the table, but use a `br_if` immediately after the call to conditionally branch if the result of the call is not `0`.      **Specific Constraint**: Ensuring the `br_if` evaluates the condition correctly, confirming that the call result is interpreted properly.      **Incorrect Condition Evaluation**: Check if `br_if` condition is always true or false irrespective of the call result.
