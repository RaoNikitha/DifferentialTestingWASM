;; Sure, here is a list of test descriptions designed to highlight differences in how WebAssembly and Wizard Engine handle loop instruction, specifically focusing on edge cases in `br_table`.  1. **Test Description**:    - Construct a loop with a `br_table` where the table index is exactly equal to the number of targets.    - Check if the implementation defaults to the correct target.    - This tests the handling of boundary conditions in `br_table`.    -

            (br_table 0 1 (i32.const 2))
          )
        )
      end)
