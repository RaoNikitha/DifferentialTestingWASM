;; 2. **Test Description**:     Insert a `nop` within a loop that also manipulates the operand stack by pushing and popping values. Evaluate if the stack maintains the correct values before and after the loop execution.    **Constraint Checked**: Validates `nop` doesn't interfere with stack operations within iterative control structures.    **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Poor stack management could cause the loop to operate on corrupted data.
