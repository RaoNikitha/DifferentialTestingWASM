;; 10. **Test Description**: Fabricate a block structure with mismatched stack unwinding after a branch to check if `wizard_engine` mishandles stack state transitions by resolving to incorrect block.     - **Constraint**: Confirm branches correctly unwind the stack to match the block type's requirement.     - **Relation**: Examines stack operations' consistency combined with branch target resolution within blocks.
