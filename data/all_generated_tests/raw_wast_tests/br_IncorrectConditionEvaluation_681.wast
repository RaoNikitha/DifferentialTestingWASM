;; 2. **Test Description:**    Execute a `br_if` instruction in a loop where the condition should evaluate to false but ensure the branch is incorrectly taken anyway. This tests the differential evaluation where incorrect popping/handling of bool conditions might erroneously result in unwarranted loop restarts.
