;; 3. **Test Description**: Construct a block with a deeply nested branching structure that includes a mix of conditional branches (`br_if`) and unconditional branches (`br`). Improperly reset context in WebAssembly might lead to incorrect execution paths.    - **Constraint Checked**: Proper conditional and unconditional branching within nested structures.    - **Relation to CFG**: Mismanagement in reset state leads to incorrect CFG branches.
