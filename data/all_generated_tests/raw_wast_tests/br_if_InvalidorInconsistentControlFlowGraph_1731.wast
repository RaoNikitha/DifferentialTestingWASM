;; 2. **Test 2**:    - **Description**: A nested loop with an inner `br_if` instruction targeting the outer loopâ€™s start. Include stack operands to check consistent stack unwinding when condition is true.    - **Constraint**: Ensuring operations target the correct loop with appropriate operand handling.    - **CFG Relation**: Validates CFG consistency for backward jumps within nested loops.
