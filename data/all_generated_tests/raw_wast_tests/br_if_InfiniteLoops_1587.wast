;; 8. **Test Description**:     - Implement a loop with multiple `br_if` statements switching between true and false conditions, ensuring proper loop continuation.    - **Constraint Checking**: Verifies alternating path execution within loop boundaries, maintaining correct stack transitions.    - **Infinite Loop Relation**: Prevents alternating paths from causing anomalies and infinite loops due to mismanagement in operand evaluation and label handling.
