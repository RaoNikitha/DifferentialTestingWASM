;; 2. **Test Description**: Place a `br_if` instruction inside an `if-else` block, where the `if` condition is false. Ensure that `br_if` does not cause a branch when its own condition evaluates to true (non-zero).    - **Constraint Checked**: Verifies that `br_if` executes only within its proper context and does not interfere with the surrounding control flow.    - **Relation to Incorrect Evaluation**: Identifies if `br_if` condition is always causing a branch, irrespective of the surrounding `if` blockâ€™s condition.
