;; 5. **Test Description**: A loop that contains a `br_if` relying on a dynamically computed condition involving function calls. The loop should break if the computed value meets certain criteria.    - **Constraint**: Verifies that `br_if` handles conditions involving dynamic function call results accurately.    - **Differential Behavior**: The loop fails to break based on the function call results, indicating a condition evaluation bug.
