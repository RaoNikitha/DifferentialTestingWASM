;; 10. **Branching to Dynamic End Label**:    - A block containing intermediary branch instructions (`br`, `br_if`) targeting the dynamic end of the block, conditioned by runtime scenarios (stack values). Check final control flow resumes as expected at the various potential end points.    - **Constraint**: Dynamic branch targets require accurate resolution at runtime, ensuring it matches expected label endpoints.    - **Focus**: Ensures runtime condition-based branching correctly resumes execution at intended targets.
