;; 6. **Test Description**:     Include `nop` instructions in recursive function definitions. Test the correctness of the stack before and after recursion to ensure `nop` does not produce incorrect stack frames.    **Constraint**: `nop` must not modify recursive call stack behavior.    **Reasoning**: Ensures that recursive stack allocations and deallocations remain intact without corruption from `nop`.
