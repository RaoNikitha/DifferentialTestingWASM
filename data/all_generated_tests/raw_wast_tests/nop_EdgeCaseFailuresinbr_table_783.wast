;; 4. **Test Description**: Define a `br_table` with varied and more number of targets than indices. Place `nop` instructions before and after `br_table`.     - **Constraint Checked**: Confirm that `nop` instructions do not affect the execution where some targets are unreachable due to insufficient indices.     - **Edge Case Relation**: The index used by `br_table` should correctly map to targets without interference from `nop`.
