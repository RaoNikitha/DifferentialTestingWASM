;; 10. **Complex Control Flow in Loop with Nop and Multiple br_if Statements**:    - Construct a loop with several `br_if` statements interspersed with `nop` instructions. This will verify if `wizard_engine` handles the context correctly without causing infinite loops due to misinterpretation of `nop`.    - Constraint: All `br_if` statements should be evaluated correctly, and `nop` should not cause infinite execution.
