;; 3. **Invalid Loop Exit Via br_if**:    - Design a test where a loop contains a `br_if` that conditionally exits the loop based on a variable not manipulated within the loop.    - **Constraint**: The context must ensure the variable used in `br_if` is defined correctly.    - **CFG Check**: Confirm that the CFG logically represents the conditional path out of the loop.
