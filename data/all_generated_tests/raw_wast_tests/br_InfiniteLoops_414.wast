;; 5. **Test Description 5:**    - A loop with a `br_if` instruction that mismatches operand types for the loopâ€™s input type, leading the loop to re-enter indefinitely.    - **Constraint: Operand Stack Management**    - **Relation to Infinite Loop:** Incorrect operand handling fails to properly exit loop.
