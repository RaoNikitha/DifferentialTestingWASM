;; 10. **Test Description**: Prepare a block which improperly mixes stack pops and pushes, leading to stack underflow at certain branch points not caught by WebAssembly but handled by `wizard_engine`.     - **Constraint Checked**: Proper stack unwinding and balancing within blocks.     - **Relation to CFG**: CFG incompleteness due to stack errors causing unexpected termination or failure to follow correct paths.
