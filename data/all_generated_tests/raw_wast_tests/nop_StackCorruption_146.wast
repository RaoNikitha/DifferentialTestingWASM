;; 7. **Test Description**:    Add `nop` before and after local variable manipulation instructions like `local.get` and `local.set`. Verify the stack state before and after such manipulations.    **Constraint Checked**: Ensures `nop` doesnâ€™t interfere with local variable stack operations.    **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Mishandling here could lead to incorrect local variable values and corrupted stack states.
