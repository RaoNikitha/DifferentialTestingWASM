;; 9. **Test 9: Conditional Return from Imported Function Based on If's Condition**:    - Description: An imported function returns conditionally based on the condition checked within an `if` instruction, ensuring stack and control flow adherence.    - Specific Constraint: The stack and labels must adhere to the `blocktype` when conditional returns are based on `if` evaluation.    - Relation to Control Flow: Checks if conditional returns from external functions align with expected control flows within `if` instructions.
