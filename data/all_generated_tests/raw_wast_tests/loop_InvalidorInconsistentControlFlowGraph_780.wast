;; 1. **Invalid Nested Loop with Mismatched Block Types**:    - Create a WebAssembly module containing a nested `loop` instruction where the inner loop's `blocktype` does not match the outer loopâ€™s `blocktype`. Verify that the context extension correctly generates and maintains CFG for nested loops in both environments.
