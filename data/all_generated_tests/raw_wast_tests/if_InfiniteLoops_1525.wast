;; 6. **Loop with False Condition Branch:**    - Test Condition: `if` instruction within a loop where the condition is always false, attempting to branch to an `else` that breaks the loop.    - Constraint: Proper execution of `else` branches without causing infinite loops.    - Relevance: Ensures accurate distinction between `then` and `else` in breaking loops.
