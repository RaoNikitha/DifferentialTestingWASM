;; 9. **`nop` Inside Memory Manipulation Controls**:    - Include `nop` within `memory.grow` or `memory.init` operations. Ensure the CFG properly interprets no operational impact despite apparent complex constructs.    - Constraint: Tests `nop` integration within memory operation CFG without altering their logic.
