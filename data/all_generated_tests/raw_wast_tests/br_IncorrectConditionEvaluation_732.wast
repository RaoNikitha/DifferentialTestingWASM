;; 3. **Test Description:**    - Test a nested loop structure with conditions based on decreasing variable values where the `br_if` condition is boundary-tested to toggle just at the threshold.    - **Constraint Checked:** Proper condition evaluation under edge cases (boundary condition change).    - **Test Relation:** Ensures `br_if` correctly evaluates threshold conditions without incorrect early exits or loops.
