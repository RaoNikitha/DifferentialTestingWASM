;; 9. **Test Case: Mismatched Nesting Labels**    - **Test Description**: Intentionally mismatch `block` and `end` pairs signifying improper nesting, then analyze if `br` instructions get incorrectly resolved due to these mismatches.    - **Constraint**: Ensures that the implementation catches nesting issues and does not misresolve `br` targets leading to incorrect code execution.    - **Relation to Mismanagement**: Mismanagement would manifest as actual jumping even in incorrectly nested code, a significant control flow fault.
