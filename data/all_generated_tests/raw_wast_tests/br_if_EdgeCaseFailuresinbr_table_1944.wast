;; 5. **Test Description**: Craft a deeply nested `loop` containing a `br_if` which targets another loopâ€™s `block`. Use a `br_table` with a negative index generated dynamically. Check `wizard_engine` for proper index handling and label argument fetching which might differentiate from WASM's implicit behavior.
