;; 1. **Test Br with Invalid Label Index:**    - **Description:** Implement a `br` instruction with a label index that exceeds the available labels in a deeply nested control structure.    - **Reasoning:** This test checks if invalid label indices cause stack corruption by referencing undefined control structures.    - **Constraint:** Ensure the label `l` is in the bounds of available nested labels.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption:** An invalid label index may bypass proper stack unwinding, potentially leaving stack elements unresolved or inconsistent before and after the branch.
