;; 1. **Call Imported Function with Mismatched Argument Types**:    Test a scenario where a WebAssembly module imports a function and calls it with arguments that don't match the expected types. This should trigger a stack type mismatch error in the wizard_engine due to its strict `popE` type checking, but may not in the WebAssembly implementation if it doesnâ€™t enforce type checks as explicitly.
