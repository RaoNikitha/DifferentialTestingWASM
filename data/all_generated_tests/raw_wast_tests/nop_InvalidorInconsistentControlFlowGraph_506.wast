;; 7. **Test 7: `nop` within Loop Invariant Code Motion**    - **Constraint Check**: Validate that `nop` in areas optimized for loop invariant code does not affect optimization and execution.    - **Description**: Insert `nop` within code identified as loop invariant and verify the optimization does not misinterpret the loop structure or iteration.
