;; 3. **Forward Branch with Operand Transfer Test**: Design a scenario with a `block` that consumes specific operands and place a `br` targeting the block. Check that the operands are correctly transferred to the operand stack after unwinding. This validates proper forwarding of operands during branch execution.
