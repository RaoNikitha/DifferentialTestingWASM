;; **Test 9: Control Structure with Conditional Return**  Develop scenarios using if-else constructs that conditionally return based on the operands processed. WebAssembly and Wizard Engineâ€™s stack and type CFG should validate how conditional structures manage returns. Ensure correct paths are reflected in CFG with proper type and operand management.  _Checks CFG balance for conditional return paths ensuring consistent final type state._
