;; 8. **Test Description**: Implement a sequence of blocks where one block incorrectly shares an operand stack state dependency with another block at a different nesting level. WebAssembly may mishandle stack states compared to `wizard_engine`'s controlled state reset.    - **Constraint Checked**: Operand stack management with nested blocks.    - **Relation to CFG**: CFG inconsistencies due to stack mismanagement affecting execution paths.
