;; 7. **Function Returning within Loop Affecting Later Calls**:    - Description: Create a loop where a function called within the loop returns a value that affects subsequent calls within the same loop iteration.    - Constraint: Validate that returned values are handled and do not cause erroneous function calls in the same loop iteration.    - Relation: Improper management of returned values can disrupt the control flow and subsequent function calls in the loop.
