;; 7. **Test Description**: Use a `loop` block where the `br` instruction branches back but the stack heights mismatched.    - **Constraint Checked**: Confirms that looping branches handle stack height requirements correctly.    - **Incorrect Condition Evaluation**: An incorrect condition might lead to malfunction in looping structure.
