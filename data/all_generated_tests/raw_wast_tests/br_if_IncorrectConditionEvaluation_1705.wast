;; 6. **Test Description**: Place a `br_if` inside a `loop` that conditionally jumps to its beginning based on the loop variable. Iterate the loop with the condition toggling between true and false.    - **Constraint Checked**: Tests correct evaluation of the loop variable and appropriate branching.    - **Relation to Incorrect Evaluation**: Highlights inconsistency in the condition check that may lead to incorrect loop continuation behavior.
