;; 3. **Empty Label Vector**:    - Description: Use a `br_table` instruction with an empty vector of label indices and an `unreachable` default label.    - Constraint: To ensure that out-of-bounds operand cases (i.e., any operand since vector is empty) lead directly to the default label.    - Relation: Validates that the implementation defaults correctly and does not intermingle out-of-bounds behaviors, ending straight into `unreachable`.
