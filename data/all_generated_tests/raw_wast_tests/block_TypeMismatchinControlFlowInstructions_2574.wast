;; 5. **Test Description**:    Create a `block` meant to produce an `i32` but inject a `br_if` that pushes an `i64` back onto the stack. Check if implementations can detect and correct type discrepancies before block ends.    **Constraint**: Conditional branches must maintain the block's type.    **Relation**: Verifies type consistency upon conditional branching.
