;; 6. **Test Description**: Insert `nop` in a sequence of `br_table` instructions and verify proper fall-through behavior and target jumps.    **Constraint Checked**: `nop` doesnâ€™t interfere with `br_table` jump targets.    **Relation to CFG**: Ensures each branch target is correctly interpreted in the table without disruption by `nop`.
