;; 7. **Test Combined `if` and `br_if` Instruction**:    - Description: Combination of `if` and `br_if` where `if` determines code block and `br_if` within that block conditionally branches.    - Constraint: Ensures accurate sequential conditional evaluations where `if` preempts `br_if`.    - Incorrect Condition Evaluation: Test if Wizard Engine fails to correctly resolve compounded conditional branches leading to flow errors.
