;; 2. **Test Description:**    - Design a loop with an inner block containing a `br` instruction that jumps back to the beginning of the loop. Make the loop consume and produce a significant number of operands. Verify the operand stack management before and after the branch to ensure that the stack remains consistent and not corrupted.
