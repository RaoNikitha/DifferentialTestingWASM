;; 6. **Test Description**: Design a `br_if` that targets a non-conditional `block` placed within another conditional `block`. Include a `br_table` instruction with indices partially validated by the containing blockâ€™s arguments. Confirm correct handling by `wizard_engine` vs. potential confusion in WASM.
