;; 10. **Test Description**:     - Create nested functions where the outer function calls the inner function multiple times with `nop` instructions interleaved in both functions. Validate consistent return behavior.     - **Constraint Checked**: No disruption in function call and return paths due to `nop`.     - **Relation to CFG**: Confirms correct function call and return pathways in CFG even with the presence of `nop`.  These test descriptions focus on ensuring the `nop` instruction does not cause any inconsistencies or invalidations within the Control Flow Graph by respecting the scaffolding provided by the WebAssembly 2.0 specification.
