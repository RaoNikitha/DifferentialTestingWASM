;; 3. **Branch to Loop Target with Incompatible Types**:    - A branch instruction within a loop that jumps to its beginning considering incorrect operand types.    - This tests whether the branch to a loop target correctly checks and manages operand stack types.    - Specific Constraint: Ensuring valid type checks on backward branches.
