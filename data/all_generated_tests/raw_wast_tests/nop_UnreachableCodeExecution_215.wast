;; 6. **Test 6**:     - Description: Validate a `call` instruction that directly precedes a `nop` within a loop where early loop termination triggers `unreachable`. This tests if `nop` near calls interfere with control flow.    - Constraint: Checking that `nop` surrounding calls does not inadvertently affect the loop termination leading to `unreachable`.
