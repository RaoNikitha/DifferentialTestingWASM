;; 1. **Test Description**: A simple nested block where the inner block's `end` is missing.    **Constraint**: Ensuring that inner blocks are correctly terminated with an `end` instruction.    **Relation to Mismanagement**: Tests if the implementation can detect and properly handle unterminated nested blocks.    ```    block      block      end    end    ```
