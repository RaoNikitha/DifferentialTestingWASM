;; 2. **Test Missing Operand for Branch Condition**:    - **Description**: Create a scenario where the stack does not contain any operand for the `br_if` condition.    - **Constraint Checked**: Checks for correct stack height and operand presence for `i32`.    - **Relation to Type Mismatch**: Highlights branch condition type and stack requirements.
