;; 10. **Test Description**:    Include `nop` within an exception handling block that modifies the stack state (try-catch). Verify the stack's integrity after exceptions are thrown.    **Constraint Checked**: Ensures `nop` does not alter stack behavior during exception handling.    **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Exception handling requires precise stack management; any corruption here can lead to further runtime errors.
