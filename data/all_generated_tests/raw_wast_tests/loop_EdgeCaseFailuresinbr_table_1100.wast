;; 1. **Test One**:    - A `br_table` with an index far greater than the number of entries in the table, targeting a `loop` block with an empty body.    - **Constraint**: Checks if out-of-bounds indices in `br_table` result in handling of the default target.    - **Relation**: Validates that the implementation handles index overflow properly by checking the default branch mechanism.
