;; 7. **Deeply Nested Arbitrary Length Block with Branch**:    - Description: Implement a deeply nested block structure with arbitrary long sequences and multiple branches.    - Constraint: Deep nesting and label management within block structures.    - Reasoning: This will test label indexing and stack height maintenance across multiple levels of nested blocks, exposing potential stack mismanagement.
