;; 3. **Test 3**:    - Use `call_indirect` to invoke a function with valid operands that contains a loop with an `i32` incrementing condition but lacks a proper `br_if` condition to exit the loop, leading to endless iteration.    - **Constraint Checked**: Verifies boundary enforcement for table indexes and proper execution of loop exit conditions in indirectly called functions.
