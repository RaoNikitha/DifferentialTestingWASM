;; 6. **Test Description:** Implement a WASM function that performs a `br` directly into a `call_indirect` to an imported function, after manipulating the operand stack within nested blocks.    **Specific Constraint:** Ensures correct stack and operand stack height management before dynamic calls.    **Relation to Control Flow Boundaries:** Validates operand integrity and control flow safety when dynamic calls are involved, especially across modules.
