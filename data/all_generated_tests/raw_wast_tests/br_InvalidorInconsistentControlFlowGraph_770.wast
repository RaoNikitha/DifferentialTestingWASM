;; 1. **Test with Undefined Label Index:**    - Construct a module with a `br` instruction that references a label index that is not defined within the structured control instructions.    - Reasoning: This tests the proper handling of undefined labels in the context. An improper label lookup could result in an invalid or inconsistent CFG.    - Relation to CFG: This would directly cause the CFG to have an invalid node, leading to potential runtime errors.
