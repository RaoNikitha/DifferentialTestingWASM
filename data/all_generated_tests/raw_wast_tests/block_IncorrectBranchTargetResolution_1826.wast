;; 7. **Test Description**: Set up a `br_table` inside a block with mismatched label entries due to incorrect indexing in wizard_engine, causing branches to incorrect blocks.    - **Constraint**: Ensure each entry in the `br_table` corresponds to its correct target block.    - **Relation**: Ensures table-based branching resolves all label entries accurately.
