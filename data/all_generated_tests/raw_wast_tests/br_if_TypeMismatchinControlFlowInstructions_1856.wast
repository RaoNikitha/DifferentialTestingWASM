;; 7. **Test Forward Branch to Block with Incorrect Operand Types**:    - **Description**: Make a `br_if` conditional branch forward to a `block` where the operand stack does not match the `block`'s expected result types.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures forward branch conformance to blockâ€™s result type requirements.    - **Relation to Type Mismatch**: Validates operand stack types align with block outputs.
