;; 5. **Test Description:**    - Design a `block` that should push two `i32` values on the stack upon completion.    - Inside this block, use both a `br_if` (with a condition resulting in false) and a `br` that incorrectly only places one `i32` on the stack.    - Checks whether the `br` instruction upholds the multiple result type requirements properly.
