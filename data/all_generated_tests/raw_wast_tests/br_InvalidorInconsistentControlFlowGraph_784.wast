;; 5. **Test Description:**    - Implement a control flow with an `if` statement that includes a nested `loop`, with a `br` instruction targeting the `loop` from within the `if`â€™s body.    - **Constraint:** Check that the branch correctly jumps to the start of the `loop`.    - **CFG Check:** Ensures that mixed `if` and `loop` constructs are correctly represented in the CFG and that backward branches are handled correctly.
