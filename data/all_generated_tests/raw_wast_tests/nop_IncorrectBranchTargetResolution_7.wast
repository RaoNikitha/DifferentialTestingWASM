;; 8. **Test Description: `br` with Intermediate `nop` in Structured Block**    - **Scenario**: Insert `nop` at various positions within a structured control block that utilizes `br` for branching.    - **Constraint**: Verifies consistency in resolving branch targets regardless of `nop` positions within the block.    - **Context**: Misinterpretation can cause the branch to land on unintended locations, altering structured block behavior.
