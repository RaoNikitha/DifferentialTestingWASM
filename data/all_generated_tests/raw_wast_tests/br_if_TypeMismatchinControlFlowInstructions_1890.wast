;; 1. **Type Mismatch in Loop Target Operand**:    - **Description**: Test a `br_if` instruction that targets a loop expecting an `i64` type operand, but provide an `i32` type instead. This should fail due to type mismatch.    - **Constraint**: Ensures that the `br_if` correctly validates operand types against the input types of the targeted loop.    - **Differential Behavior**: WASM should catch the type error immediately, whereas wizard_engine might mishandle the stack reference entries.
