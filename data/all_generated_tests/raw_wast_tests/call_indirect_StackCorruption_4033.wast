;; 2. **Insufficient Operands on Stack**:    - Construct a scenario where `call_indirect` is made with a type signature requiring more operands than present on the stack.    - Constraint Check: Validate operand stack handling and verify the expected number of arguments are consumed.    - Stack Corruption Relation: This can lead to operand stack underflow, causing subsequent instructions to fail.
