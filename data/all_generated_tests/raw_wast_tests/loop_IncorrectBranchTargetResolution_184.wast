;; 5. **Branch to Loop with Non-Matching Block Type**:    - **Description**: Test branching to a loop where the block type does not match the expected type for the branch, leading to unintended type errors and control flow issues.    - **Constraint**: Correct validation of block types and ensuring consistent operand and result types for branches.
