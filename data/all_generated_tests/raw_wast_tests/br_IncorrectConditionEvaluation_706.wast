;; 7. **Test Description 7:** Verify a `br_if` conditioned on the result of a logical AND between two boolean values on the stack. Incorrect handling of boolean operations can lead to spurious branches.    - **Constraint Checked:** Logical AND operations handling.    - **Differential Behavior:** Wizard Engine may consider logical AND to always resolve to true or false regardless of operands.
