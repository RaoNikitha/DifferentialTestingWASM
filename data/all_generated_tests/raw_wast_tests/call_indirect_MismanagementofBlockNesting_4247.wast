;; 6. **Test Description:**    Use nested block structures with `br_if` instructions alongside `call_indirect` to ensure correct branch conditions inside nested blocks are respected, and correct block exits occur.    - **Constraint Checked:** Branch condition management with nested blocks.    - **Mismanagement Relation:** Double-checks that conditional branching does not lead to incorrect handling of nested blocks.
