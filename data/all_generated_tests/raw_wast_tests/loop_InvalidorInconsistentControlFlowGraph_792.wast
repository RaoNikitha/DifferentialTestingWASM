;; 3. **Conditional Branches Skipping Loop Reinitialization**:     - **Description**: Use `br_if` within a loop to conditionally skip initializing the loop block by jumping to the end. Verify if reinitialization of the loop execution occurs correctly based on the stack contents.     - **Constraint**: Conditional branching within loop execution.     - **CFG Impact**: Conditional branches should not lead to skipping initialization, but incorrect CFG might cause early exit or incorrect loop re-entry.
