;; 2. **Conditional with Unreachable Else Branch:**    - Context: Construct an `if` block where the `else` branch contains only the `unreachable` instruction.    - Constraint: Check whether CFG properly handles the unreachable-ness of the `else` branch and doesnâ€™t allow control flow to exit normally.    - Expected Behavior: When the condition is false, a trap should occur. Both implementations should handle this uniformly.
