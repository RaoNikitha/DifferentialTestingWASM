;; 5. **Test Description:**    - Use `unreachable` within a `block` that nests another `block` which in turn uses an `i64` value. The outer block expects an `i32` result.    - **Constraint Checked:** Verifies type compatibility in nested control flow structures with `unreachable`.    - **Relation to Type Mismatch:** Ensures nested instructionsâ€™ type checks do not conflict due to `unreachable`.
