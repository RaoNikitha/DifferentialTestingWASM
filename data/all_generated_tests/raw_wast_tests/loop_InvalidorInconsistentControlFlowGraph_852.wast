;; 3. **Incorrect Backward Branching**:    - **Description**: Create a loop with a complex control flow where `br_if` instructions conditionally branch to the loopâ€™s beginning. The conditions ensure some paths never branch back.    - **Constraint Checked**: Accurate backward jump handling and proper unwinding of the operand stack.    - **CFG Relevance**: Ensures the CFG correctly accounts for all possible paths, particularly backward branches, and reflects loop reinitializations.
