;; 6. **Function with Intermediate Label and `br_if` Termination**:    - Write a function containing labels with intermediate positions and conditional branches (`br_if`) ending with a return. Verify if the label stack transitions correctly during the return.    - **Reasoning**: Ensures that context transitions are managed accurately around return instructions, avoiding faulty label stack state transitions.
