;; 9. **Test Description: Insert `nop` in an infinite loop using multiple nested control structures (`block`, `loop`, `br_if`).**    - **Reasoning**: Confirm that `nop` does not interfere with nested control structures.    - **Check**: Proper control flow should be maintained without infinite execution.
