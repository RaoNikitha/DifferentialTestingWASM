;; 10. **Test Description: Interleaved Concurrent Control Structures**    - **Reasoning**: Interleaved `block`, `loop`, and `if` structures with conditional branches that expect specific stack states.    - **Constraint Checked**: Context maintenance and consistency across interleaved control structures.    - **Inconsistent CFG**: The CFG creates invalid paths through control structures due to improper context switching.    - **Expected Differential Behavior**: WASM detects a generic error in control flow, whereas wizard_engine identifies specific variances with `OobLabel` or `EmptyValueStackExpecting` errors.
