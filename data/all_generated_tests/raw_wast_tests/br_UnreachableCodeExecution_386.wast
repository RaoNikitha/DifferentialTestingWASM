;; 7. **Test 7: Loop with Forward Branch to Unreachable**    - Establish a `loop` that includes a forward `br` instruction targeting a block label following the loop and insert an `unreachable` in the loop.    - Ensures that the correct target label is addressed without erroneously encountering the `unreachable`.
