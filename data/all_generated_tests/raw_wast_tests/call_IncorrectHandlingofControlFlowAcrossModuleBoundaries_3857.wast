;; 6. **Section and Type Context Alignment Across Boundaries**:    - **Reasoning**: This test ensures alignment of type contexts and sections between calling and called modules.    - **Description**: Design modules where calls to imported functions require specific section and type context alignments. Check if both WebAssembly and wizard_engine maintain consistent section and type alignment during the transition.
