;; 2. **Test 2: Function Call in Loop with Incorrect Index**      Description: Construct a loop within a function where the `call` instruction references a non-existent function index. The test checks whether the implementations correctly handle invalid function indices and whether they correctly resolve the loop exit branch.      Constraint: The function index used in the `call` instruction must be out of bounds.      Relation to Branch Target Resolution: An invalid function index should trap correctly, but handling errors during index checking may lead to incorrect branching within the loop.
