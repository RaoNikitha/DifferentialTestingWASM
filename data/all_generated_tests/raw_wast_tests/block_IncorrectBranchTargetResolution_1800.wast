;; 1. **Test Block with Mismatched `br` Target**:    - Create a `block` that contains a `br 1` instruction where no such label exists beyond its immediate scope.    - This tests whether branch target resolution correctly identifies and errors on invalid target indices.    - Expected result: WebAssembly should throw an error due to incorrect branch target, while wizard_engine might proceed incorrectly.
