;; 8. **Multiple Unreachables within Loop**:    - **Description**: Design a loop containing several `unreachable` instructions at different control points within the loop body.    - **Constraint Checked**: Validates multiple unreachable points handling within a loopâ€™s execution path.    - **Unreachable Execution Check**: Ensures that reaching any unreachable instruction in different branches of the loop causes the expected trap.
