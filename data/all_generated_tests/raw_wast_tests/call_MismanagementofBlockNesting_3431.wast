;; 10. **Br If with Invalid Call and Nested Loops**:    - **Description**: Construct a nested loop structure with conditional exits (`br_if`) and place an invalid `call` instruction within the conditionally exited inner loop.    - **Constraint**: The function index used in the `call` should be non-existent and inside an inner loop with conditional exit.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: Identifies potential issues when handling conditional exits within nested loops and invalid function calls.
