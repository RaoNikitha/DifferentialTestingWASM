;; 2. **Mismatched Stack State Prior to Unreachable in a Block**:    - Design a `block` where the expected stack state before encountering the `unreachable` instruction does not match due to a branch instruction. This will test if the context handles stack manipulations correctly and prevents reaching an `unreachable` instruction unexpectedly.
