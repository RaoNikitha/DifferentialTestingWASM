;; 5. **Unwinding Stack with Conditional Branches**: Develop a nested loop with conditional branches (`br_if`) that depend on the stack values. This test checks if the stack is correctly unwound and operands are managed properly when branching to the loopâ€™s start and correctly pushing operands back.
