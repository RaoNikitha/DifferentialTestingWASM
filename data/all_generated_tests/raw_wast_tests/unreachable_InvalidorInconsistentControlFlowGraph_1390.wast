;; 1. **Test Unreachable within Valid Loop:**    - Context: Place an `unreachable` instruction directly inside a loop, immediately followed by an instruction normally valid in the loop context.    - Constraint: Verify if the CFG correctly identifies that the loopâ€™s body cannot proceed beyond the `unreachable`, ensuring control flow is consistently terminated.    - Expected Behavior: Both implementations should trap correctly without further loop body execution.
