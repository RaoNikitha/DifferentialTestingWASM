;; 6. **Test 6**: Construct a loop that executes a `br_table` based on a non-integer operand, forcing the use of the default label. Verify the operand stack is unwound and operands pushed back properly.    - **Constraint**: Ensures correct stack management when default label is used.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Improper stack unwinding can trap the loop in an infinite state.
