;; 9. **Test Description**: Design a test where `br_if` instruction operates inside a loop with a continuous `i32` decrementing counter to check its behavior when it turns zero.    - **Constraint Checked**: Proper handling of counter conditions.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: If the `br_if` does not properly break out when `i32` reaches zero, the loop will keep executing indefinitely.
