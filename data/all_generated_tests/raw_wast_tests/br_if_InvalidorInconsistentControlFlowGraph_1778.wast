;; 9. **Test Case 9**: Implement a `br_if` within a loop that includes multiple nested `if` blocks, specifically targeting proper backward branching and operand stack resolutions.    - **Constraint Checked**: Correct behavior of loops with nested conditions under backward branching.    - **CFG Relation**: CFG potentially having incorrect backward jumps or unresolved stack states during conditional branching in loops.
