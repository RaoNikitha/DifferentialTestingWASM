;; 8. **Test for Forward Branch Operand Requirements:**    - **Description**: Forward branch to blocks/if structures ensuring operands are correctly placed on operand stack.    - **Constraint Checked**: Forward branches handling operand requirements accurately.    - **Relation to CFG**: Ensures forward branching maintains operand consistency in CFG.
