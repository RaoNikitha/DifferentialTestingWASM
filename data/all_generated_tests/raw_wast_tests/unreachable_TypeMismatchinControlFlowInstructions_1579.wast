;; 10. **Test Description:** Implement `unreachable` within a `return` construct that would prematurely interrupt the type management of post-return instructions.    **Constraint:** Ensures stack types expected after return are properly handled when interrupted by `unreachable`.    **Reasoning:** Validates type enforcement and stack correctness even during premature returns caused by `unreachable`.
