;; 2. **Test Description**: Inside a `block`, use `br_if` to conditionally break out to an outer `block`. The `br_if` should supply arguments matching the blockâ€™s results. Test for correct stack alignment after branching.    - **Constraint Checked**: Operand stack alignment in block targets.    - **CFG Relation**: Validates that the CFG correctly unwinds and matches stack states for branches targeting blocks.
