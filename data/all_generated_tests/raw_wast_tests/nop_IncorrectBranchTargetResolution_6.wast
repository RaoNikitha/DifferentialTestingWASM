;; 7. **Test Description: `br` and Function Call with `nop`**    - **Scenario**: Combine `br` instructions with function calls within the same block, including `nop` instructions.    - **Constraint**: Ensures `nop` does not interfere with branch targets and function calls within the same execution context.    - **Context**: Incorrectly resolved branches can cause jumps over function calls or unintended code execution.
