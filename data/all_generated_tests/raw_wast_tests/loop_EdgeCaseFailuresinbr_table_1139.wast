;; 10. **Test Case 10**: A `loop` block where the `br_table` includes an index that falls exactly at the boundary of the available targets (upper limit).     - **Constraint**: Ensuring precise boundary condition handling at the limit of valid indices.     - **Relation to br_table Edge Case**: Verifies differential behavior at the upper boundary of target index lists within loops.
