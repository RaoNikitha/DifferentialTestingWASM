;; 2. **Unmatched `block` and `end`**:    - **Test Description**: Craft a block containing a loop where an `end` instruction is misplaced or missing, leading to infinite execution.    - **Constraint**: Ensuring proper nesting of `block` and `end` instructions so the loop terminates.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Misplacement or absence of `end` can cause the block to become unbounded.
