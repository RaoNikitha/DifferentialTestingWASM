;; 1. **Test: Calling an Exported Function with `br_if` in a Conditional Block**    - **Constraint Checked:** Ensure that `br_if` correctly transitions control to an exported function within a block, respecting the operand stack.    - **Description:** Export a function with conditional logic using `br_if`. Call this function from another module and verify that control transfers back to the caller module correctly after executing the branch in the callee module's block.
