;; 3. **Test Description**: Implement a recursive function that triggers a loop with a `br_if` that depends on a base case condition check inside the function. The base case should eventually terminate the loop.    - **Constraint**: Ensuring proper stack management and base case check for recursion during function calls.    - **Infinite Loop Relation**: If recursion or base case handling fails, the loop may invoke the function indefinitely leading to infinite recursion.
