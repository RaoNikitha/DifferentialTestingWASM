;; 9. **Test Description**:     Define a `loop` with multiple iterations and include a `br_if` to exit the loop under a certain condition. Ensure that the stack state is maintained across multiple loop exits.    - **Constraint Checked**: Loop exit conditions and stack restoration.    - **Stack Corruption Check**: Ensures stack integrity on non-trivial loop exits.
