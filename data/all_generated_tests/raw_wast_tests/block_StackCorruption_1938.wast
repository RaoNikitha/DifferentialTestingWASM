;; 9. **Test Description**: Create a complex `block` with mixed types of instructions (e.g., arithmetic followed by control flow instructions) that improperly manipulate the stack by leaving intermediate results unhandled.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures all intermediate results within a block are correctly managed and the stack remains balanced throughout.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Mismanaged intermediate stack states can cause cumulative stack corruption affecting subsequent operations and nested blocks.
