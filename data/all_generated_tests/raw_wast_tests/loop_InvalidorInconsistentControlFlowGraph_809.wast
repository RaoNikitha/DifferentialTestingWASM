;; 10. **Test Reinitialization Side Effects**:     - Set up a `loop` with side-effect-inducing instructions that should reset upon branching but fail to do so, affecting subsequent iterations.     - **Constraint**: Correct reinitialization of loops.     - **CFG Impact**: Failing to reset can generate CFG paths with inherited side effects, leading to incorrect or inconsistent behavior.
