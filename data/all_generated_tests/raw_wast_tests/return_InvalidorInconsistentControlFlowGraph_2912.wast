;; **Test 1: Validating Type Mismatch in Stack Operands at Return**  Create a WASM module with a function that pushes different types of operands onto the stack before returning. In one implementation, this should raise a type mismatch error at return due to improper stack unwinding (as per WASM spec). The Wizard Engine should properly detect and raise an error if the stack types donâ€™t match the expected return type, while the WebAssembly implementation should also ensure stack types comply with function signature on return.  _Checks for incorrect CFG management due to unexpected operand types on stack during return._
