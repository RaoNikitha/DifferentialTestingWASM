;; 6. **Loop with Incorrectly Popped Operand Stack**:     - **Description**: Create a loop structure that improperly handles stack operands by misaligned popping and pushing during branch execution. Validate preservation of stack integrity.     - **Constraint**: Ensure stack consistency during branch execution.     - **CFG Impact**: Mismanaged operand stack results in incorrect branching in CFG, invalidating loop structures.
