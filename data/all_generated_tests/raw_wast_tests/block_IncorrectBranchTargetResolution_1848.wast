;; 9. **Forward and Backward Branching Combined**:    - Scenario with mixed forward (`br`) and backward (`br_if`) branching within nested blocks. Forward branches exit the block, while `br_if` branches backward within the current block. Validate correct control flow and stack handling.    - **Constraint**: Mixed forward and backward branches should resolve correctly concerning their respective labels.    - **Focus**: Ensures mixed-direction branches are accurately managed within nested blocks.
