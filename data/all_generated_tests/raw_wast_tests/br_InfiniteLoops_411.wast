;; 2. **Test Description 2:**    - A loop that includes a `br_if` with a condition that incorrectly references a deeply nested label index, causing the loop to incorrectly evaluate the condition and never exit.    - **Constraint: Label Lookup Constraint**    - **Relation to Infinite Loop:** Incorrect label index results in the condition never being met, causing an infinite loop.
