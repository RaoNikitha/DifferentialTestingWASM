;; 2. **Mismatched Operand Stack in Loop:**    - Test Description: Within a loop structure, include a `br` instruction that inappropriately unwinds the operand stack, ignoring the correct stack height and leading to execution of an `unreachable` instruction inside the loop.    - Constraint: This test ensures the operand stack is properly unwound when branching back to the beginning of a loop.
