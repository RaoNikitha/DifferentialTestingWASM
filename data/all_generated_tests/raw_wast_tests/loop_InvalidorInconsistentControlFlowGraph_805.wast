;; 6. **Test Unwinding and Operand Replacement**:    - Design a `loop` with multiple backward branches where operations before the branches return operands that are not the same type as when initially branched.    - **Constraint**: Correct operand stack unwinding and replacement.    - **CFG Impact**: Incorrect operand flow can mislead type handling in CFG, leading to type errors.
