;; Test 10: - Test by deliberately creating a label collision scenario with multiple `br_if` instructions targeting the same label number but in differently structured nests (loop and block combinations). Validate the precise jump resolution. - **Constraint Checked**: Stack Polymorphism and Consistent Label Handling. - **Relation to Incorrect Branch Target Resolution**: Tests the ability to handle label collisions accurately, ensuring different nestsâ€™ contexts are respected.
