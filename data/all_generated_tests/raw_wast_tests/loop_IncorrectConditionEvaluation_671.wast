;; 2. **Test Description 2**:    - **Test**: Loop with nested `br_if` instructions and a condition that becomes false after the first iteration.    - **Constraint**: Ensure that after the condition becomes false, the loop does not branch.    - **Reason**: Incorrect condition evaluation might lead to perpetual branching, causing infinite loops.
