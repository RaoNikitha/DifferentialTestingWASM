;; 4. Implement nested `blocks` with a `loop` inside, and within the `loop`, place a `br` instruction targeting the outer block. The test checks that the `br` instruction exits the `loop` and continues execution after the outer blockâ€™s `end`. This validates correct unwinding from loops to outer blocks.
