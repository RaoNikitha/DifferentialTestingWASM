;; 9. **Error Handling in Function Call within a Br Block:**    - Design a `block` containing a function call (`call`) which triggers an error (e.g. divide by zero) followed by a `br` instruction to a recovery block. Verify that all ephemeral state such as operand stack and error handling is correctly managed and the branch behaves consistently.
