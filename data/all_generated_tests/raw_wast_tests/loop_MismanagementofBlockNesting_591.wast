;; 2. **Loop within Conditional with br_table**:    - Test Description: Implement a scenario with a loop inside an `if` condition that branches using `br_table` to different labels based on conditional evaluation.    - Constraint: Verify the handling of `br_table` within nested structures, particularly the label vector indexing.    - Relation: This test exercises nested conditional and loop contexts to detect errors in label stack management and branching to correct depths.
