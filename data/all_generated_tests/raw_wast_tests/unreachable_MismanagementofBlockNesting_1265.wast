;; 6. **Test: Loop with Unreachable and Variable Scope**    - **Description:** Create nested loops with variable declarations and references. Place an `unreachable` within the innermost loop and include branch instructions (`br`) interacting with these variables.    - **Constraint Checked:** Ensures that `unreachable` does not disrupt the correct scope and handling of variables within nested loops.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting:** Tests if nested loop variables are managed correctly in the presence of an `unreachable` instruction.
