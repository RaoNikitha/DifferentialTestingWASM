;; 6. **Test 6: `br_table` With All Identical Targets Except One After `nop`**    - Include a `nop` before a `br_table` where all branch targets are identical except one which is invalid. This will test whether the `nop` causes any anomalies.    - Constraint: Confirm that the `nop` does not affect the `br_table`'s correct branch selection and proper trap handling for the invalid index.
