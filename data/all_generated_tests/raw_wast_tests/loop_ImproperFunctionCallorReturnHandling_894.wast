;; 5. **Loop with Function Call and Stack Unwinding**:    - Description: Design a loop where function calls within the loop manipulate the operand stack, and ensure stack unwinding occurs correctly when `br` or `br_if` instructions are used.    - Constraint: Check if the operand stack is correctly unwound and reinitialized, affecting subsequent calls.    - Relation: Improper stack unwinding can lead to invalid states for function calls and returns.
