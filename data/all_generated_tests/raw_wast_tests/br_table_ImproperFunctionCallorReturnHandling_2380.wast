;; 10. **Test Description: Handling Function Call from Catch Block:**    - Design a `br_table` that leads into a function call from within a catch block, to test exception handling interaction.    - **Constraint Checked:** Tests proper stack management and control flow from exception handling into a function call.    - **Relation to Incorrect Exception Handling:** Ensures correct branching and function call handling from catch blocks without breaking the control flow.
