;; 8. **Test Description**:    - Construct a loop containing a complex `br_table` with mixed valid and out-of-bounds indices. This test will check for differing branching behaviors and confirm default target handling for all invalid indices.    - **Constraint Checked**: Handling multiple branching behaviors and default target execution in cases of mixed valid and out-of-bounds indices in `br_table`.
