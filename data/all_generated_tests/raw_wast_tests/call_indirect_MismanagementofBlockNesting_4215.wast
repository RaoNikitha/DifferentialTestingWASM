;; 4. **Test Description**:     Develop a scenario with an outer loop containing an inner block. Inside the block, use a `call_indirect` instruction to call a function, followed by a `br` instruction to break to a specific block depth.    **Constraint**: Validate that the break instruction correctly exits to the intended block and that the `call_indirect` properly handles the dynamic type checking.    **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: Ensures that the break instruction does not confuse the nesting, leading to incorrect block exits or type mismatches.
