;; 2. **Test Description: `br_if` with Conditional Branching and `nop`**    - **Scenario**: Use `br_if` to conditionally branch based on a value on the stack, alongside `nop` within the same block.    - **Constraint**: Verifies if `nop` disrupts conditional branching where the target label should remain unchanged.    - **Context**: Incorrect label resolution can divert the branch to an unintended target, depending on the stack state.
