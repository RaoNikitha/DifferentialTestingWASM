;; 4. **Test Description**:    Precede a `br_table` instruction with a complex control flow containing multiple `nop` and nested blocks. The test should check if the `nop` instructions interfere with the nested structure's validation.      **Specific Constraint**: Context and control flow impact of nested blocks with `nop`.      **Edge Case**: Nested structures with `br_table`.
