;; 9. **Nop in Try-Catch with Type Mismatch**:    - Implement a `try-catch` block where the try section involves a `nop` and invalid type change, while catch expects another type.    - Checks proper type handling across exceptional control flows with `nop`.    - **Reasoning**: Verifies type correctness in exception handling paths.
