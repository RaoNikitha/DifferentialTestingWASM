;; 6. **Test 6: Forward Branching in a Loop**    - Description: Test a loop where `br_table` performs forward branching to a block outside the loop.    - Specific Constraint: Ensure forward branches target correct blocks and exit the loop properly.    - Infinite Loop Relation: Incorrect forward branching can cause the loop to not terminate.
