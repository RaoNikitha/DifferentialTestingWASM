;; 4. **Test Description:**    - Incorporate an outer loop with inner loops where the inner loop's `br` instruction should take the control out to resume execution at the outer loop, simulating `continue` behavior. Verify the correct label indexing with `depth` being greater than the top of control stack.    - **Constraint:** The focus is on validating the correct branching to loops with complex control flow and ensuring thereâ€™s no infinite loop due to incorrect label validation or depth check.
