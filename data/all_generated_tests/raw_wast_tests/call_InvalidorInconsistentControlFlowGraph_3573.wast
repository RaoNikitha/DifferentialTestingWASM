;; 2. **Incorrect Loop Structure with Function Call**:    Design a test with a function call inside a loop where the loop's boundaries and conditions could lead to misalignment or unbalanced stack operations. This ensures that the CFG correctly manages the loop's control flow when encountering call instructions.
