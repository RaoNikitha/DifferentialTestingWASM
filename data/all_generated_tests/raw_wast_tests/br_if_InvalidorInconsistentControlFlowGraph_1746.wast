;; 7. **Test Description: Unconditional Branch to Loop Start with Incorrect Stack**    - Define a `loop` where `br_if` unconditionally (with true condition) jumps back but the operand stack is not correctly ordered or insufficient.    - **Constraint Check**: Ensure stack order and height integrity for backward branches.    - **CFG Relevance**: Confirms backward jumps to loop start aligning with CFG stack requirements.
