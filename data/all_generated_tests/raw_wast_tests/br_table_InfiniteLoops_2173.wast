;; 3. **Test 3**: Design a loop that utilizes `br_table` with an operand stack containing multiple data types. Ensure the type matching for all labels is accurately enforced.    - **Constraint**: Ensures operand type consistency across labels.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Misaligned operand types can cause the loop to not resolve properly, leading to an infinite loop.
