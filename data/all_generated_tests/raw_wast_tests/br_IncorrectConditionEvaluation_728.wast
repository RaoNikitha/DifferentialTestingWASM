;; 9. **Test Description:**    Verify a scenario where multiple `br_if` instructions target different structured control instructions based on different conditions, ensuring each branch is taken correctly.    - **Constraint Checked:** Handling multiple `br_if` instructions with different conditions in one context.    - **Relation to Incorrect Condition Evaluation:** Ensures each `br_if` condition evaluation is treated independently and correctly.
