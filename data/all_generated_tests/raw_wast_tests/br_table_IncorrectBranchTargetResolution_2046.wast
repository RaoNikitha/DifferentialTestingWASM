;; 6. **Backward Branch in Loop with Mismatched Operands:**    Define a `br_table` with backward branching and mismatched operand stacks.    - **Test Constraint:** Backward branches need to match the operand requirements of the loop.    - **Expected Differential:** WebAssembly should enforce operand type compatibility, whereas wizard_engine might incorrectly loop back.
