;; 10. **Test Description**: Construct a block with conditional branches (`br_if`) based on complex logical conditions derived from combining multiple stack values.     - **Constraint Checked**: Validates handling of complex logical conditions and correct evaluation for branching.     - **Relation to Condition Evaluation**: Faulty logical evaluations or condition checks inevitably lead to incorrect branching decisions.
