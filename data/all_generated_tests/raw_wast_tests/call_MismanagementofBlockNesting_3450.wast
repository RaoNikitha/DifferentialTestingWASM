;; 9. **Test 9**:    - **Description**: A `call` instruction inside a loop that also contains block instructions with varying types being pushed and popped from the stack.    - **Constraint Checked**: Validates stack type consistency and correctness during multiple stack push and pop operations within nested loops and blocks.    - **Relation to Block Nesting**: Ensures correct stack operation sequence and type checking across nested loops and blocks.
