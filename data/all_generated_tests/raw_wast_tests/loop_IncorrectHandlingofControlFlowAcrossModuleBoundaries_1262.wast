;; 3. **Indirect Function Call Within Loop**:    - **Description**: A WebAssembly module (A) makes an indirect call to an imported function from module B within a loop. The indirect call index is derived from the operand stack. Ensure that the loop and the operand stack are correctly managed during and after the indirect call.    - **Constraint**: Validate that the indirect call respects type constraints and does not corrupt the stack or loop control flow.
