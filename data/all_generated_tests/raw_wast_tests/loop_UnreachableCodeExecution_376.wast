;; 7. **Loop with Stack Unwinding Reaching Unreachable**:    - Create a loop in which stack unwinding from branches incorrectly leads to an `unreachable` instruction.    - **Constraint**: Checks proper stack unwinding and operand handling.    - **Relation to Unreachable Code Execution**: Validates stack unwinding does not erroneously place control flow on an `unreachable`.
