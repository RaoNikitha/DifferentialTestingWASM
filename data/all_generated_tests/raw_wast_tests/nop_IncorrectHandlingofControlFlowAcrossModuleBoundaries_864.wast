;; 5. **Test: Control Transfer Between Modules with Nop in Function End**    - Generate two modules. Module A contains a function ending with `nop` instruction and exports it. Module B imports this function and calls it, ensuring correct execution from call to function end.    - **Constraint Check**: Validates `nop` placement at function end does not mismanage control transfer between modules.    - **Relation to Differential Handling**: Context reinitialization by wizard_engine might lead to unsuccessful end-function control transfer validation.

  (import " A" "f" (func $a (type $t0)))
  (func $b (nop) (call $a))
