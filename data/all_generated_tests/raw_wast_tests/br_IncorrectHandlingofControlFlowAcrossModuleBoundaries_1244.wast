;; 5. **Test Description:**    - Define a module exporting a function that performs complex operand stack operations followed by a `br`.    - Import and execute this function, and confirm that the operand stack unwinding and restoration operate correctly.    - **Constraint:** Ensure that complex stack manipulations followed by branches maintain integrity across module transitions.
