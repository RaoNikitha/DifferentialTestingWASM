;; 2. **Test: Deep Nesting with Unreachable**    - Use `block` and `loop` instructions to deeply nest an `unreachable` and then follow with more complex operations like `i32.add`.    - **Stack Corruption Check:** Test how stack states are reset and maintained after deep nesting and `unreachable` execution.
