;; 7. **Test Description**: Implement a loop with `nop` at the end, just before the looping back `br_if` condition.    - **Constraint**: Confirms that placing `nop` at various positions does not affect the looping back condition.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Ensures the loop condition behaves as intended and does not cause continuous execution.
