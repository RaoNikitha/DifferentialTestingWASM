;; 2. **Mismatched Operand Stack Management:**    - Use a `br` instruction within a `block` that incorrectly handles operand stack types before and after the branch.     - **Constraint Checked:** Operand stack type matching and restoration.    - **CFG Impact:** If the operand stack is not correctly unwound and restored, subsequent operations might process incorrect values, leading to erroneous control flow.
