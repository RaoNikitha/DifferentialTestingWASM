;; 2. **Conditional Branch Always False**:    - Create a block with a `br_if 0` instruction driven by a condition expected to be true (e.g., `i32.const 1`). Ensure the instruction within the block is executed.        Constraints: This test verifies if the `br_if` instruction evaluates the true condition correctly to branch and does not skip block instructions.
