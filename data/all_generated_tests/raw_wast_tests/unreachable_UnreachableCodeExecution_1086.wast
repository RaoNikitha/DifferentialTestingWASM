;; 7. **Test for traps after a continuation with `br_if`:**    - Use `br_if` to conditionally skip `unreachable` instructions and verify this results in proper reachable code execution.    - **Constraint:** Validates correct implementation of conditionally executed traps.    - **Related to**: Checks for misinterpretations in conditional branching commands nuanced by unreachable scenarios.
