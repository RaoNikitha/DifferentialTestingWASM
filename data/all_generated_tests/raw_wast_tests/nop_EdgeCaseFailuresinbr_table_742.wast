;; 3. **Test Description**: Position a `nop` instruction right before a `br_table` such that the stack remains unchanged for branching operations in any context within the instruction sequence.    - **Constraint**: Ensuring `nop` does not change stack for the `br_table` execution.    - **Edge Case**: `br_table` functionality with indices out-of-bounds and ensuring no interference from `nop`.
