;; 1. **Test Description:** Create a test where an `unreachable` instruction is placed within a `block` tag, followed by instructions attempting to add two integers.    **Constraint:** Ensure that, after triggering the trap via `unreachable`, the stack type consistency is disrupted by adding integers.    **Reasoning:** This checks if the implementation can handle stack type mismatch after the trap within a block context.
