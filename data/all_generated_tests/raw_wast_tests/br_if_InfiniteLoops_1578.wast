;; 9. **Test Name: Condition Mis-evaluation**    **Description:** Design a test where the condition on the stack is misinterpreted by `br_if`, due to misplaced stack management or condition checks.    **Infinite Loop Relation:** Incorrect condition checks cause incorrect loop exits, resulting in infinite loops if the branch condition is improperly evaluated.
