;; 7. **Circular `br` Instructions**:    - Create a structure where `if` and `else` blocks within a nested structure contain `br` operations that reference each other in a circular manner.    - Highlight issues in managing label indices through cyclical branch scenarios.    - Ensures that infinite loops or cyclic branch resolutions are handled correctly.
