;; 5. **Test: Loop with Recursive Function Call**    - **Description**: Test a loop with a nested recursive function call, which itself contains a loop.    - **Constraint Being Checked**: Proper handling of nested contexts and stack management.    - **Mismanagement**: Stack errors leading to incorrect branching or unwinding.
