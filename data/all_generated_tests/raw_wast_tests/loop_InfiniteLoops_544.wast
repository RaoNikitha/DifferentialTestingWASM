;; 5. **Test Description**: Implement a loop with an instruction sequence such that the stack unwinding for a `br` instruction targeting the loop is not done correctly, forcing an infinite loop.    **Constraint Checked**: Ensures stack unwinding is performed correctly when a `br` instruction is executed within a loop.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Detects any failures in stack unwinding mechanisms leading to perpetual loop execution.
