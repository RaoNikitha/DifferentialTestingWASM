;; 4. **Test Description**: Design a loop that contains a `br_table` instruction which always chooses an index that results in a backward jump, ensuring the loop executes indefinitely.    **Constraint Checked**: Correct processing of `br_table` values and indexing.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Confirms the correct interpretation of indices within `br_table` and checks for improper index handling that could lead to infinite loops.
