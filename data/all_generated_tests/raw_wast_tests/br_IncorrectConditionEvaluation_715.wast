;; 6. **Test: Multiple `br_if` with Different Data Types**    - **Description:** Create a series of `br_if` instructions with conditions based on different data types (integers, floats, etc.). Each condition should accurately reflect the data type's logical value.    - **Constraint:** Verify that each `br_if` correctly evaluates its condition based on the data type, ensuring consistency in condition evaluation across types.
