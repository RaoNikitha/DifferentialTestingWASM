;; 2. **Test 2: Incorrect Operand Count for Block**    - **Description**: Construct a block that expects two operands, and use `br_if` to branch to the block but only provide one operand.    - **Constraint Checked**: Validate that the `br_if` enforces the correct number of operands required by the block.    - **Relation to Type Mismatch**: Incorrect operand count leads to stack mismanagement and type mismatches.
