;; 4. **Test Description: `br_table` Multiple Targets with Interspersed `nop`**    - **Scenario**: Use `br_table` to define multiple branching targets, interspersed with `nop` instructions.    - **Constraint**: Ensures `nop` does not affect the proper indexing and resolution of targets by `br_table`.    - **Context**: Mislabeling induced by `nop` can lead to jumping to incorrect code segments as per the table.
