;; 3. **Test for Index Overflow with Large Table in `br_table` Followed by Valid `call_indirect`**:    - Create a large `br_table` with many targets and use an index that overflows the value bounds. Follow with a valid `call_indirect` to observe how handling large tables impacts invocation.    - Constraint: Large table and overflow index.    - Relation: Scrutinizes index handling in large table scenarios and subsequent function invocations.
