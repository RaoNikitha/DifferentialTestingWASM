;; 1. **Test Description:**     A function that includes a `br_table` instruction with an index that exceeds the number of available targets, followed immediately by the `unreachable` instruction to ensure the trap is triggered regardless of the invalid index.    **Constraint Checked:** Tests how each implementation handles an out-of-bounds index in `br_table` leading to a trap.    **Edge Case Relation:** Ensures the invalid index results in a consistent trap when combined with the `unreachable` instruction.
