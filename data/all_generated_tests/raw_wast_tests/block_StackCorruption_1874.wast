;; 5. **Test Description**: Use a block that immediately branches out to the end, skipping the rest of its instructions, and verify if the stack state remains consistent with expectations.    - **Constraint**: Tests whether forward branches are correctly managing the stack.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Failure in handling forward branches as expected might leave the stack in an incorrect or corrupted state.
