;; 5. **Test Description**: Use a `block` combined with `loop` and `br_if` where unmet conditions ensure continued loop execution unless the block type enforces early termination correctly.    - **Constraint**: Tests correct `br_if` condition handling and checking that block structure prevents infinite looping.
