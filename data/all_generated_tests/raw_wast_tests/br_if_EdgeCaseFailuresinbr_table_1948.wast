;; 9. **Test Description**: Implement a conditional `br_if` leading out of an `if` block nested in a `loop` with mismatched operand stack types. Following it, insert a `br_table` whose index initially matches to available targets but exceeds later. Confirm nuances between `wizard_engine`'s handling and WASM.
