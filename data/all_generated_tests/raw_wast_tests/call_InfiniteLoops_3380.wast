;; 9. **Unreachable Code Paths within Nested Loops**:    - **Description**: Set up deeply nested loops, where each contains `call` instructions leading to functions with unreachable code based on conditional branches.    - **Reason**: This examines proper exit from deeply nested loops using unreachable code. Mismanagement can lead to infinite loop conditions.
