;; 4. **Test Description**: Use a `br_if` instruction to conditionally call an exported function from another module within an `if` statement, and check if the stack state is preserved correctly.    - **Constraint Checked**: Correctly validating stack preservation after conditional function calls across module boundaries.    - **Relation to Control Flow**: Ensures that the stack's integrity is maintained when conditionally moving control flow across module boundaries.
