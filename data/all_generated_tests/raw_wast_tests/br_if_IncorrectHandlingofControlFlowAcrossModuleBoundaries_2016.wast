;; 7. **Test Description:** Construct a WASM module with a deep nesting of `if`, `block`, and `loop` control structures, using `br_if` extensively, and import a function altering the depth.    **Constraint Checked:** Depth-relative label indexing and stack unwinding during nested control structures.    **Relation:** Tests accurate reference and execution of deep nested control structures across module boundaries.
