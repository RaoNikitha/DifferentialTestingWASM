;; 4. **Incorrect `br` Targeting**:    - **Test Description**: Introduce a `br` instruction within a nested loop structure improperly targeting the wrong block, causing the code never to exit the loop.    - **Constraint**: Ensuring `br` instructions correctly target the intended block, especially in deeply nested loops.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Incorrect `br` references can keep re-executing the loop unintentionally.
