;; 4. **Test 4**: Create a function that encompasses multiple loops, each with a `br_table` branching to different targets based on a counter. Configure the targets to have different operand sequences.    - **Constraint**: Checks operand stack management and proper type matching.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Mismanagement of operand stack can prevent correct loop termination.
