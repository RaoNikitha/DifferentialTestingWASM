;; 8. **Test Description**: Utilize an `if` block to determine entry into a `loop`, where the `then` block contains deep nesting of `if` conditions with multiple unresolved branches (unmatched labels or stack state).    **Constraint Checked**: Confirms the correct nesting and branching behavior under deep nested conditions.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Unresolved branches or incorrect nesting could result in the loop failing to terminate properly, running indefinitely.
