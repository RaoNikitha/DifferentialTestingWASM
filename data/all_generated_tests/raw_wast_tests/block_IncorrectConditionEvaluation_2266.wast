;; 7. **Test Description**: Define a block with a conditionally terminated sequence using `br_if` where the condition is derived from indirect memory access operations.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures memory access operations feed the condition accurately for `br_if`.    - **Relation to Condition Evaluation**: Incorrect memory handling or condition checks may result in unintended branches.
