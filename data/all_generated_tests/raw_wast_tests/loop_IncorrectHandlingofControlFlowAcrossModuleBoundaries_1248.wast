;; 9. **Test: Loop with Recursive Call to Exported Function**    Description: Develop a loop that calls an exported function which recursively calls another function within the same module boundary. Verify that control flow and stack unwinding/rewinding are handled correctly.    Constraints:    - Ensure proper handling of recursive calls across module boundaries.    - Validate stack consistency throughout recursion and loop transitions.    - Confirm correct operand and result types after function returns.
