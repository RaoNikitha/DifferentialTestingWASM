;; 9. **Test 9: Stack State Mismatch from Erroneous Loop Inside Branch**    - **Description**: Create a loop within the `then` block of an `if` instruction that improperly manipulates the stack, causing state mismatches when execution reaches the `else` block.    - **Constraint Checked**: Proper stack management around loops nested within `if` branches.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Mismanaged loops within branches can severely corrupt stack states, leading to execution errors outside the loop context.
