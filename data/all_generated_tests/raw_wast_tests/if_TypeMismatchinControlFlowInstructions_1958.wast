;; 9. **Test Description**: Design a test for a `loop` instruction within an `if` block where the inner loop produces a mismatching type (`i32` vs expected `f32`).    - **Constraint Checked**: Validate correct type transitions within loops nested in conditionals.    - **Expected Behavior**: The test would expose failures in handling control flow type mismatches in nested constructs.
