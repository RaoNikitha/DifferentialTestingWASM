;; 9. **Chain of False Conditions Blocking Execution**:    - Create a chain of `if` and `block` constructs with `br_if` instructions all set to false conditions. Check if execution continues linearly through all blocks without any unexpected branching, testing the serial evaluation of multiple false conditions.
