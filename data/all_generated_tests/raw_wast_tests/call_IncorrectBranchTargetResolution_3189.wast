;; 8. **Test Handling Traps with Function Calls**:    - **Description**: Invoke a `call` instruction that is designed to trap (e.g., invalid memory access).    - **Constraint**: Confirms that traps are properly captured and navigated.    - **Relation to Incorrect Branch Target Resolution**: Unhandled traps could result in unintended branch jumps post-recovery or incorrect function invocation.
