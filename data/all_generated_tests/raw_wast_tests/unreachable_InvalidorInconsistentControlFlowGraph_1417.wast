;; 8. **Test Description:** Position `unreachable` within loops containing back-edge branches and control transfers like `br_if` and `br_table`. This ensures CFG handles complexity in branched loops and doesn't misinterpret trap states.    - **Constraint:** Trap should prevent all back-edge branches.    - **Relation to CFG:** Ensures correct CFG handling of loop back-edges and control transfers.
