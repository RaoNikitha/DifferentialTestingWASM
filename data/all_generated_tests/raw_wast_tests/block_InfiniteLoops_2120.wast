;; 1. **Infinite Loop with `br_if` Miscondition**:    - **Test Description**: Create a block with a loop inside that includes a `br_if` condition evaluating to false due to an improperly managed condition. This will loop infinitely if the framework mishandles the exit condition.    - **Constraint**: Ensuring `br_if` condition is evaluated correctly to break out of the loop.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Incorrectly handling the `br_if` instructionâ€™s condition can cause code to loop indefinitely.
