;; 8. **Test Description**: Provide a sequence of `call_indirect` instructions that progressively increase table indices, ending with an index just out of range, checking for correct boundary handling and trapping.    - **Constraint Checked**: Table indexing and boundary conditions.    - **Relation to Improper Handling**: Ensures robust boundary and range checks to prevent improper function calls.
