;; - **Test 3**:   Nest multiple `if` statements, where an inner `br_if` pushes a value type different from what the outer `if` expects (e.g., inner `if` pushing `i32` while outer expects `f64`).   - **Reason**: Ensures nested control structures adhere strictly to expected type constraints.   - **Constraint**: Nested types must match the encompassing control structureâ€™s expected result type.
