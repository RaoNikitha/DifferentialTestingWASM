;; 10. **Test Description:**    Create nested loop structures where `unreachable` is inside the innermost one, combined with `br_table` instructions at various outer loops and block levels, focusing on trap and block exit consistency.    *Constraint Checked:* Correct evaluation of control structure depth and ensuring `unreachable` traps as expected within complex nesting.    *Mismanagement Focus:* Potential escape from incorrect nested structures revealing control flow issues when `unreachable` is executed.
