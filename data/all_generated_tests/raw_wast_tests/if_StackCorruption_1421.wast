;; 2. **Test Name: Block Type Incongruence**    - **Description**: Set up `if` blocks with mismatched `blocktype` output expectations between `then` and `else` sections, particularly focusing on a misaligned stack after execution to induce a validation trap specifically due to inconsistent stack states.      ```wasm      (i32.const 1) (if (result i32) (i32.add) else (i32.add (i32.const 1)) end)      ```    - **Reasoning**: Checks how each implementation verifies resultant stack conformity post `if` block execution.
