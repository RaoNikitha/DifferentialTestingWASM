;; 10. **Mixed Structured Control Instructions with `br` to Outermost and Unreachable in Inner Structures:**    - Combine `block`, `loop`, and `if`, where a `br` instruction within an innermost structure targets the outermost block, with `unreachable` within inner structures.    - Checks that `br` across different structures respects label indexing and navigation, avoiding unreachable code in mixed contexts.
