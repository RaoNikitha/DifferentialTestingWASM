;; 10. **Reenter Block with Incorrect Stack State:**     - Define a loop block where `br_table` re-targets the block, and the instruction should ensure stack state is appropriate for reentry.     - *Testing for*: Correct stack unwinding and reentry management.     - *Constraint*: Backward branch and stack management.
