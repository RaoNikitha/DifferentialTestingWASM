;; 2. **Test Missing End for Nested Block**:    - Description: Define a nested block structure but deliberately omit the `end` for the inner block.    - Constraint: Verify if the implementation can catch missing `end` instructions.    - CFG Relevance: A missing `end` can lead to an incomplete CFG, causing improper nesting and branching paths.
