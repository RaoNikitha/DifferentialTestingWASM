;; 3. Test Description: Develop a block with nested blocks, each having `call` instructions to different functions with varied return types. The outer block should expect a specific return type from the nested calls. WebAssemblyâ€™s `check_block` should ensure proper stack transitions, while `wizard_engine` might not correctly handle the nested stack states.
