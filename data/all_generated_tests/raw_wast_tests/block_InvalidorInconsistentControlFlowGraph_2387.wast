;; 8. **Test Description**: Implement a block where an inner block is missing the correct result type at the end.    - **Constraint**: Ensure that the result type of inner blocks aligns with what is expected.    - **CFG Relation**: Ensures the CFG properly enforces stack height and types at block boundaries.
