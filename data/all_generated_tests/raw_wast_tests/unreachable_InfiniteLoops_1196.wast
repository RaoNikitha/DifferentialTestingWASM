;; 7. **Test 7:** Create a loop containing multiple levels of branching with `unreachable` placed at various branch points.    - **Constraint:** Ensure that reaching `unreachable` via any branch results in an immediate trap.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops:** Confirms that all branches lead to a proper termination without infinite looping if `unreachable` is encountered.
