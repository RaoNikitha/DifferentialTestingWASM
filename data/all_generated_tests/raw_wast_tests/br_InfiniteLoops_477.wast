;; 8. **Test Description**: Create a loop containing a series of nested blocks wherein a `br` instruction should exit a specific block, not the loop. Make sure the loop has a `br_if` to evaluate a condition that exits the loop entirely.    **Constraint**: Ensures correct unwinding of the operand stack and context labeling.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Incorrect block unwinding might prevent loop exit, causing infinite loops.
