;; 7. **Test Description**: A loop where a counter conditionally decrements, and a `br_if` checks if the counter has reached zero to break. The loop should terminate when the counter hits zero.    - **Constraint**: Tests accurate decrement tracking and condition evaluation in `br_if`.    - **Differential Behavior**: Loop continues past zero or breaks early due to faulty evaluation of the decrement condition.
