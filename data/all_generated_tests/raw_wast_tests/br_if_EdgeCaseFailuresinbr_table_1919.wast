;; 10. **Test 10: `br_if` with the condition-producing i32 generated from complex arithmetic**    - **Constraint**: The condition for `br_if` derived from complex stack operations.    - **Check**: Confirms branch decision based on the accurate evaluation of the condition.    - **Relation to Edge Cases**: Tests if `br_table` correctly interprets complex conditions leading to jumps, ensuring the stack state is managed accurately before and after the branch.
