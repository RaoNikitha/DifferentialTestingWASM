;; 10. **Test Description**: Use a sequence of instructions before a block that heavily modifies the stack and a block that assumes an incorrect initial stack state or misplaced values due to the preceding instructions.    - **Constraint**: Checks for proper handling of stack values between pre-block instruction sequences and entering a block.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Misinterpreting stack state before a block entry can lead to a corrupted operand stack, making subsequent operations erroneous.
