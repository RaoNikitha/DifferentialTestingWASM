;; 4. **Test for Invalid Table Entry Handling in Loop**:    Create a situation where the `call_indirect` points to an invalid entry in the table (e.g., a `null` reference). Embed this in a loop with a `br` instruction incorrectly implemented such that it always jumps back to the start, leading to an infinite loop instead of trapping.
