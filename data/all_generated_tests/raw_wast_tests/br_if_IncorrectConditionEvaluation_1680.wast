;; 1. **Test Description:** Test `br_if` instruction with a true condition (non-zero value) to ensure the branch is taken properly. If the branch is always taken regardless of condition, it might indicate incorrect condition evaluation.    - **Specific Constraint:** Validate that condition (operand value) correctly triggers the branch.    - **Relation to Incorrect Condition Evaluation:** Ensures that true conditions are necessary for the branch decision.
