;; 6. **Incomplete Operand Stack**:    - Test a `call_indirect` with insufficient operands on the stack for the target function, ensuring a trap occurs for underflow.    - This checks if both implementations validate operand stack requirements before execution.    - It relates to `br_table` for verifying the correct operand stack depth and operand integrity.
