;; 4. **Call from Block with Forward Branch after Return:**    - Description: Define a function that calls another function within a `block`. Use a `br` to branch out of the block after the function call and ensure the proper return value after the branch.    - Constraint: This test verifies that the `br` instruction maintains correct control flow and operand stack management in the presence of function calls within blocks.
