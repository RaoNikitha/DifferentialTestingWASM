;; 10. **Test Description:**     - Integrate `br_table` into `if` conditional blocks surrounded by `unreachable` to identify consistent trap enforcement within conditional logic altering control flow.     - **Constraint:** Asserts `unreachable` enforces traps, halting subsequent conditional and `br_table` evaluations.     - **Relation to Edge Case:** Focuses on control flow consistency when conditional and `unreachable` overlap.
