;; 6. **Test 6: Call with Type Mismatch**    - Design a test where the called function expects different types than what the `call` instruction provides, leading to a type mismatch.    - **Specific Constraint**: Ensures that type mismatches are caught and proper error handling prevents 'unreachable' execution.    - **Test Relation**: Incorrect type handling might push the function erroneously to an 'unreachable' control path.
