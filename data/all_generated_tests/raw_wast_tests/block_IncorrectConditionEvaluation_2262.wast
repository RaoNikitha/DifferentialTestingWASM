;; 3. **Test Description**: Implement a block with `valtype?`, execute arithmetic operations followed by `br_if` using the result of these operations.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures the block's stack operations and condition evaluation on `br_if` work correctly.    - **Relation to Condition Evaluation**: Errors in stack operations or condition checks could lead to incorrect branches.
