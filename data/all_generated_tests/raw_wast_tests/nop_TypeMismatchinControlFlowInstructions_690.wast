;; 1. **Test for Inconsistent Types in Loop Body**:    - Create a loop with an expected integer on the stack, then place a `nop` inside the loop. Follow this with an operation that produces a float.    - This should check if the `nop` instruction incorrectly allows continuation with a mismatched stack type.    - **Reasoning**: Ensures `nop` doesn't alter type validation within loops, and mismatched types are caught.
