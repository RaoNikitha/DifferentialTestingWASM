;; 7. **Function Call after Branching**:    - **Description**: Place a `br` instruction inside a block followed by a function call. Test if the block correctly branches and then calls the function post-branch.    - **Constraint**: Ensure correct execution order after branching within a block.    - **Improper Handling**: The function call could be skipped or improperly executed after the branch.
