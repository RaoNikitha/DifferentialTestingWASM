;; 9. **Test Case 9: `nop` before and after control transfer instructions, eventually `unreachable`:**    - **Constraint Checked:** Proper handling of control transfer (e.g., `br`) with `nop` instructions.    - **Expected Behavior:** Control transfers as expected and hits `unreachable`, causing a trap.    - **Differential Behavior:** Initialization issues in wizard_engine could mismanage control flow.
