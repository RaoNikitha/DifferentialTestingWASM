;; 10. **Loop branching with Unexpected Execution Reinitialization**:    - **Description**: Test loops where branching (`br`) unexpectedly causes loop execution to reinitialize from an incorrect point due to faulty label handling.    - **Constraint**: Ensuring that loop reinitialization only occurs at the start of the loop, target labels correctly resolve to the intended block start.
