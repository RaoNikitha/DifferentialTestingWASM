;; 10. **Test Description:**    A block wrapping a loop where `br_if` checks a condition altered in another nested block, leading to an unexpected infinite loop.      **Constraint Checked:** The impact of nested blocks on conditional branching and state.      **Relation to Infinite Loops:** Ensures that the context is properly managed and updated across nested blocks and loops.
