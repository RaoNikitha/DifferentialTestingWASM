;; 9. **Test Description:**    - Construct a control structure where a `loop` contains a `block`, which in turn contains another `br` instruction targeting the `loop`.    - **Constraint:** Verify that the branch results in a correct backward jump to the `loop`â€™s start.    - **CFG Check:** Tests for CFG consistency in handling nested loops and blocks with branches targeting loops.
