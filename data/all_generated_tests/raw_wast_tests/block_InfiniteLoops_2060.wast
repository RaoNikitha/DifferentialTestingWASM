;; 1. **Test Description:** Define a `block` with a `blocktype` requiring an integer return, but omit the `end` instruction, causing improper nesting.     - **Constraint Checked:** Ensures correct handling of well-nested blocks, and verifies if infinite loops occur due to missing `end` instruction.     - **Infinite Loop Relation:** Missing `end` might cause reading past the block, resulting in executing unexpected code and an infinite loop.
