;; 10. Implement a combination of `if`, `block`, and `loop` instructions where an `if` block's `else` contains a branching instruction that must correctly unwind and reinitialize the stack within nested constructs.    - **Constraint**: Validate proper stack unwinding and branching within mixed constructs.    - **Behavior**: Mismanagement might cause incorrect stack state or control jumps.  Each test corresponds to constraints set forth by the WebAssembly if-instruction specification and explores potential mismanagement of nesting and label scope that needs to be validated against different implementations.
