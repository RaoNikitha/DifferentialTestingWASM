;; 10. **Test with Overflow Operand:**     - Description: Include a `br_table` that receives an operand beyond the allowed i32 limit, to test how overflow is treated and whether it falls back to the default label.     - Constraint Checked: Operand bounds checking and fallback mechanism.     - Relates to Unreachable Code Execution: Overflowing operand could lead to an incorrect branching if not handled properly, hitting the `unreachable` instruction.
