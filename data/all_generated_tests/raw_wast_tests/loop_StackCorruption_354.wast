;; 5. **Test for Mixed Types in Loop Operand Stack**:    - Construct a loop that manipulates mixed types (e.g., integers and floats). Ensure type consistency on the stack before and after the loop.    - **Constraint**: Proper type management and stack type checking during loop iterations.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Mismanagement of different types on the stack can cause data corruption.
