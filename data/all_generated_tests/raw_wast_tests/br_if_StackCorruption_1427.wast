;; 8. **Test Description**:     Create a function with mixed `call` and `br_if` instructions where `br_if` targets a `loop` in the function. Check if the function manages stack frames correctly during branch execution.    - **Constraint Checked**: Stack frame consistency during conditional calls and branches.    - **Stack Corruption Check**: Prevents corruption during function calls and conditional branching.
