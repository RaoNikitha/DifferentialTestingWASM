;; 7. **Test Description:**    - Design a `loop` with an inner `block` that terminates with `unreachable`, and a `br` instruction intending to break out of the loop. Once the block is executed, the trap must occur.    - Constraint: Experiments with `unreachable` embedded in `block` instructions within loops.    - Infinite Loop Relation: Confirms that the trap inside the `block` prevents infinite loop execution.
