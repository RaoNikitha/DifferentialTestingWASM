;; 5. **Test: Loop with Conditional Exit via `br_if`**    - **Description:** Construct a loop where the exit condition relies on a `br_if`. The loop should only exit if the condition becomes true after a certain number of iterations.    - **Constraint:** Ensure that the `br_if` condition is correctly evaluated within the loop context and leads to the correct loop termination, validating correct in-loop condition checks.
