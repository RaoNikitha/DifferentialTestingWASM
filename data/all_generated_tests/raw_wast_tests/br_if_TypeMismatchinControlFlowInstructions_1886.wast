;; 7. **Test Case 7**:    - **Description**: Construct a sequence where multiple `br_if` instructions are used within a `loop` and the operand types are deliberately interchanged (`i32` and `i64`). Ensure `br_if` jumps based on the wrong operand type.    - **Constraint**: Checks the handling of operand stacks and verifies that type mismatches are correctly flagged when a `br_if` targets a `loop`.
