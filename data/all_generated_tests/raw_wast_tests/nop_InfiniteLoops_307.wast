;; 8. **Validation of Loops with Nop and Unreachable Code Path**:    - Design a loop containing `nop` instructions followed by an `unreachable` instruction to simulate conditional break paths. This will ensure `wizard_engine` does not misinterpret `nop` leading to infinite loops.    - Constraint: Loop should break on `unreachable`, and `nop` should not interfere.
