;; 3. **Test for `br_table` with Multiple Branch Targets**:    - Use a `br_table` inside a loop with multiple branch targets, including one that restarts the loop and one that exits. Check the stack state at the end.    - **Constraint**: Correct determination and handling of branch targets, ensuring stack consistency.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Mismanagement of branch targets can lead to incorrect stack operations and corruption.
