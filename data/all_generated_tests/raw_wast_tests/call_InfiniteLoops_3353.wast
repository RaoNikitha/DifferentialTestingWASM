;; 2. Implement a loop that uses `br_if` to conditionally exit based on a stack value. Ensure the function index is invalid during exit conditions. The differential behavior will be shown if the WebAssembly implementation handles the invalid index error, whereas the `wizard_engine` may incorrectly proceed, resulting in an infinite loop.
