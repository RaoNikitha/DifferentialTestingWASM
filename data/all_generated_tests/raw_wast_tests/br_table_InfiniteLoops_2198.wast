;; 8. **Test 8: Incorrect Index Encodings in `br_table`**    - Description: Use `br_table` with incorrectly encoded indices for labels, observing how both engines handle the error.    - Specific Constraint: Tests for proper encoding checks and out-of-bounds handling.    - Infinite Loop Relation: Misencoded factors leading to incorrect branching may cause loops to not exit.
