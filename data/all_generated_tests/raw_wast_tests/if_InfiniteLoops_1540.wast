;; 1. **Test Description**: Test an `if-else` block within a loop that uses nested `br_if` instructions. Ensure that the `then` part of the `if` contains `br_if` to break the loop based on a nested condition within a series of complex instructions.    **Constraint Checked**: Validates the correct propagation of labels and stack state management within nested blocks.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: If the `br_if` condition fails to break the loop due to improper stack or label management, the loop will run indefinitely.
