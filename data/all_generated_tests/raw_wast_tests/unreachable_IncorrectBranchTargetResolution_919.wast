;; 10. **Test Description:** Place multiple `unreachable` instructions within different control flow constructs (blocks, loops, if-else) and use a complex set of `br` instructions with mixed levels of nesting to ensure each `br` resolves to the intended target.     - **Constraint Checked:** Validates mixed nesting and complex branching scenarios.     - **Incorrect Branch Target Relation:** Ensures mixed nesting `br` instructions resolve to correct targets, avoiding unintended `unreachable` traps.
