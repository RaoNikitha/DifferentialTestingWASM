;; 8. **Test 8: Loop with External Function Call and `nop`**:    - **Description**: A `loop` that makes an external function call on each iteration interspersed with `nop` instructions.    - **Constraint**: Ensure that `nop` does not obstruct function calls or loopâ€™s control flow.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Validates that `nop` does not mistakenly keep the function call out of execution, preventing loop termination.    - **Example**: `(loop $L (nop) (call $someFunction) (br_if $L (i32.const 0)))`
