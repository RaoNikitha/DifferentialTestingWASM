;; 4. **Unreachable in a Loop with Call:**    - **Test Description:** Define a function that contains a loop calling another function, and within the loop, an `unreachable` instruction is executed if the loop condition changes.    - **Constraint Checked:** Ensures the loop execution behaves as expected with immediate traps due to the `unreachable` instructions without valid exits.    - **Improper Handling Aspect:** Validates that loop iterations are interrupted by unreachable traps and do not continue invalid function call sequences.
