;; 2. **Test Description**:    Design a `block` with nested `block` sequences where an inner block branches to an outer blockâ€™s end, terminating execution inside an outer block and hitting an `unreachable` instruction. This test ensures proper handling of nested branching and accurate trapping on `unreachable` within nested blocks.
