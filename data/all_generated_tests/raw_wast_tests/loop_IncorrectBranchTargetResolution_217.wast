;; 8. **Test Input: Loop with interleaved br**    - Description: Test a `loop` block interleaved with conditional `br_if` that should continue execution, but due to improper label resolution, it halts.    - Constraint: Ensure proper continuation of execution across conditionally branched loops.    - Focus: Verify that `br_if` respects the continuation semantics within loops.
