;; 1. **Test with `nop` inside a `loop` followed by `br 0` (loop back to the start)**:    - **Constraint**: Ensures that `nop` inside a loop doesnâ€™t affect control flow causing an infinite loop.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: If `nop` improperly affects the loop, `br 0` won't exit after the intended iterations.
