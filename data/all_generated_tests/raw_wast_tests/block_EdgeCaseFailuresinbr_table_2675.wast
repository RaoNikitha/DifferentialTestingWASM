;; 6. **Test Description**: Define a `block` that includes a `br_table` where the index is dynamically calculated and could overflow to the default branch.    - **Constraint**: Ensure that dynamic indices resulting in overflow are managed correctly and that the block execution flow handles these without errors.    - **Edge Case**: Handling of dynamic, potentially overflowing indices ensuring default branch resolution works.
