;; 1. **Test Description**: Create a test where `call_indirect` is used inside a loop with a `br_if` condition that depends on the result of the `call_indirect`. The loop should exit when a specific condition is met, but due to improper operand handling, the condition is never satisfied, resulting in an infinite loop.    - **Constraint Being Checked**: Proper handling of operand stack and correct evaluation of the `br_if` condition.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Incorrect stack operation can lead to `br_if` never evaluating to true, causing an infinite loop.
