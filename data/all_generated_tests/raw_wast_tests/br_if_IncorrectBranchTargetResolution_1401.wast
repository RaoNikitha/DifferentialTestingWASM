;; 2. **Test Description**: Create an `if` block inside a `loop`, with a `br_if` that conditionally targets the loop. Verify branching to the loop's start.    - **Constraint Checked**: Label management and backward jump resolution.    - **Related Issue**: Correct identification of `loop` output type and jumping to the loop's start.
