;; 4. **Loop Back-Edge with Stack Condition**:    - **Description**: Execute a loop with a `br_if` that conditionally jumps back to the beginning. Emphasize stack content checks at the branch point to ensure the stack is properly managed.    - **Constraint Checked**: Correct stack management at loop back-edges.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Verifies that jumping back in a loop does not cause stack corruption.
