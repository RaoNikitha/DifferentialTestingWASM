;; 3. **Test Description**: An `if` block that conditionally enters another `loop` based on stack condition. The loop body contains additional `if` conditions with complex branching that may either re-enter the initial loop or break from it.    **Constraint Checked**: Ensures correct `if` condition evaluation and nested loop handling.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Incorrect `if` evaluation or branching might result in the loop never being exited properly, leading to an infinite loop.
