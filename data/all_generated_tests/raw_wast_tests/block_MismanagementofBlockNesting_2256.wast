;; 7. **Test Description**: Utilize a nested block which includes conditional branches (via `br_if`) within inner blocks, testing the stack unwinding and operand consumption requirements for each successful branch.    - **Constraint**: Check operand stack behavior for nested `br_if` branches within blocks.    - **Nesting Mismanagement Check**: Confirms that operand stack is correctly handled during conditional branching within nested blocks.
