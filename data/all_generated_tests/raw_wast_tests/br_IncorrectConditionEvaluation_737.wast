;; 8. **Test Description:**    - Test an early exit with `br_if` where the condition evaluates an external functionâ€™s side effect (e.g., function that alternates return values). Ensure branching only occurs in expected cycles.    - **Constraint Checked:** Proper handling of side-effect conditions in branching.    - **Test Relation:** Ensures that condition evaluation respects external function side effects and branching accurately.
