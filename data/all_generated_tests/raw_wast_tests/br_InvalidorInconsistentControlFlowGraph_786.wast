;; 7. **Test Description:**    - Create a nested control structure containing an empty `block` followed by another `block` with a `br` instruction targeting the outer `block`.    - **Constraint:** Ensure that the branch correctly identifies the outer `block`, even when intermediate blocks are empty.    - **CFG Check:** Tests the CFGâ€™s robustness in handling labels in presence of empty intermediate control constructs.
