;; Test 4: Construct a block with a single loop where `br_if 0` should break out of the loop. The block type specifies an `i32` result, which is not produced due to incorrect operand stack management. Check if WebAssembly correctly resolves the break and produces the expected result, while `wizard_engine` falls into an infinite loop.
