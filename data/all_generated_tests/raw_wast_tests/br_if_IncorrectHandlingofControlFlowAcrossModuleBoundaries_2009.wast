;; 10. **Test Description**:    - **Scenario**: Use a `br_if` inside an exported function's loop, which loops back to the start conditionally based on an imported module call.    - **Constraint**: Validate that loopâ€™s operand stack integrity is maintained during the conditional back-jump.    - **Differential Focus**: Highlight discrepancies in how loop inputs are managed between the two implementations, especially across module boundaries.
