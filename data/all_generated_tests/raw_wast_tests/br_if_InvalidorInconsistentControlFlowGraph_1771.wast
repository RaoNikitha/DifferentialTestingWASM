;; 2. **Test Case 2**: Implement `br_if` where the conditionally branched label targets a block with expected output types mismatched with the current operand stack.    - **Constraint Checked**: Validation of operand stack unwinding and type alignment with target blockâ€™s expected output.    - **CFG Relation**: CFG inconsistencies due to incorrect type stack validation, leading to execution errors or invalid state transitions.
