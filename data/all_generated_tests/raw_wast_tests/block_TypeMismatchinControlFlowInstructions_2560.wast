;; 1. **Test Description**:    Ensure that a `block` construct with an explicit block type that outputs a value type, but with inner instructions that do not produce the required stack values, raises a type error.    **Constraint:** Checking for correct operand stack production as per the block type.    **Relation to Type Mismatch:** Verifies adherence to stack changes dictated by block type.
