;; 3. **Test Description**:    Implement deeply nested loops within blocks where inner loops regulate control flow using `br` instructions targeting the outermost blocks. The purpose is to test if the context is adequately managed for deep nesting and correct unwinding of the operand stack back to the initial block state after the `br`.
