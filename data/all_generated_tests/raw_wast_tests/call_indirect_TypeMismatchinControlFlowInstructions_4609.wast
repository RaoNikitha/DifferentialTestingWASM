;; 8. **Test Description**:    - Execute `call_indirect` in a switch-case control structure where one case provides an insufficient number of operands compared to the function signature, checking for accurate operand stack management leading to a trap.    - **Constraint Being Checked**:      - Accurate operand stack processing and validation against the function's required parameter structure.    - **Relation to Control Flow Instructions**:      - The test validates the correctness of stack operations within complex multi-path control flows.
