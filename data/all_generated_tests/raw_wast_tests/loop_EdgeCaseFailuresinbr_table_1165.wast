;; 6. **Test Description**:     Create a loop structure where `br_table` targets labels that are conditionally updated, with indices potentially out-of-bounds after execution path changes.     - **Constraint**: Validates branch target resolution as labels dynamically change due to control flow.     - **Edge Case**: Verifies runtime dynamic index adaptability in `br_table` resolution.
