;; 4. **Testing Loop Control Flow with Nop Interspersed Before br Instruction**:    - Place multiple `nop` instructions before a `br` instruction within a loop. The differential test will ensure that `wizard_engine` does not erroneously create an infinite loop by mismanaging context initialization due to `nop`.    - Constraint: Loop should exit on `br` as expected; `nop` should not alter this behavior.
