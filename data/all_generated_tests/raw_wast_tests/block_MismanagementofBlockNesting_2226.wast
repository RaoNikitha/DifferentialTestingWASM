;; 7. **Test 7: Cross-Nesting Interaction with Unwind Mechanism**    - **Description:** Tests behavior with cross-referencing of nested blocks using the `br` instruction, focusing on the unwind mechanism.    - **Constraint:** Validates the correct unwinding and rebinding of stack state across cross-referencing of nested blocks.    - **Mismanagement Check:** Proper handling of nesting and unwinding depth in complex nested structures.
