;; - **Test 9**:   Include a `loop` followed by a `br_if` that incorrectly pops values of type `i32` when the loop expects those of type `i64`.   - **Reason**: Loop instructions require consistent type management across iterations.   - **Constraint**: Loop branches must align with the loopâ€™s structured type expectations.
