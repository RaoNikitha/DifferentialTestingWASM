;; 3. **Mismatched `blocktype` within Loop**:    - **Test Description**: Use a `block` with an incorrect `blocktype` inside a loop causing mismatched stack operations that lead to infinite loops.    - **Constraint**: Verifying that the `blocktype` is correctly handled and does not mismatching with stack operations inside a loop.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Mismatched `blocktype` can lead to improper stack behavior that never resolves correctly.
