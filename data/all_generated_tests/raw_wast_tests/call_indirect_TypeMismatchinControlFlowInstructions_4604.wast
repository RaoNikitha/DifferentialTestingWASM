;; 3. **Test Description**:    - Execute a `call_indirect` with an invalid `typeidx` that does not reference a valid function type within the module's type section, expecting the system to trap due to an undefined type reference.    - **Constraint Being Checked**:      - That all type indices (`typeidx`) in the module are valid and properly defined in the type section.    - **Relation to Control Flow Instructions**:      - Validates that control flow mechanisms reference correct and pre-defined types, ensuring type safety.
