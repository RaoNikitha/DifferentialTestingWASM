;; 5. **Uninitialized Operands on Branch**:    - **Description**: Construct a loop where branches (`br` or `br_if`) consume operands inconsistent with the loopâ€™s expected input type.    - **Constraint Checked**: Operand stack management and type consistency.    - **CFG Relevance**: Validates the CFG handles operand stack unwinding and type correctness before and after branch execution.
