;; 9. **Test Randomized Operand Stack Push/Pop with Br Instructions:**    - **Description:** Randomize push/pop operations on the operand stack before executing various `br` instructions.    - **Reasoning:** This test stresses stack consistency and the resilience of operand stack management under randomness.    - **Constraint:** Maintain stack height correctness relative to each branch point.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption:** Randomized operations could easily expose improper stack management, resulting in underflows or overflows.
