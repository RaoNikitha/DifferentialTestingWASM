;; 7. **Test of Connecting Function Calls with Loop Constructs via br_table**:     - Create a function that is called within a loop, with loop control transitions directed by `br_table`.    - *Constraint*: Ensure loop constructs and their flow controls interact correctly with function calls.    - *Relation to Improper Function Call or Return Handling*: Ensures that function call handling does not interfere with loop control via `br_table`, maintaining separation of concerns.
