;; 8. **Test Description:** Develop a WASM function with multiple `if` statements nested within a loop, using `br` to branch out from an `if` and then making a call to an exported function from another module.    **Specific Constraint:** This checks operand stack transition and nested `if` structures handling integrity.    **Relation to Control Flow Boundaries:** Tests the resilience of stack and control flow when `br` interacts with nested `if` and transitions between modules.
