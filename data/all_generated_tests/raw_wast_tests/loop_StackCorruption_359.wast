;; 10. **Test Loop with Simultaneous `br_if` and `br_table`**:    - Combine `br_if` and `br_table` instructions in a single loop to induce complex branching. Ensure the integrity of the operand stack throughout.    - **Constraint**: Correct handling and resolution of multiple branching instructions affecting the stack.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Simultaneous complex branching can lead to stack inconsistencies or corruption if improperly managed.
