;; 10. **Test Description:**     A construct with an `if`, a nested `block` and two `br_if` instructions inside the blockâ€”one conditional on equality and the other on inequality of stack values. Test ensures each `br_if` correctly evaluates its respective condition and executes the appropriate branch.     - **Constraint:** Ensures correct evaluation of equality and inequality conditions in nested blocks with `br_if`.
