;; 3. **Test Description**: Implement a `br_if` instruction pointing to an `if` block where the condition is always false. Follow this with a `br_table` that uses an index larger than the table size. Examine if `wizard_engine` fails gracefully while WASM could potentially crash or have undefined behavior.
