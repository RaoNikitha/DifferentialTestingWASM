;; 10. **Test Description**: Utilize a loop where `nop` precedes an increment operation followed by a `br_if` condition that checks the incremented variable to break the loop.     - **Constraint**: Ensures `nop` correctly performs no action, maintaining the expected variable value for the condition.     - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Prevents the loop from running infinitely due to incorrect increment handling influenced by `nop`.
