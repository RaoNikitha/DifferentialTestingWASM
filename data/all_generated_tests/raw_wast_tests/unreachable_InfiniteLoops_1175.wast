;; 6. **Test Description:**    - Embed `unreachable` within a `loop` that checks a variable and performs a `br` if a certain condition is met. The loop should trap if the condition check fails.    - Constraint: Ensures `unreachable` interrupts the loop as expected.    - Infinite Loop Relation: Tests that the loop does not execute repeatedly due to conditional trapping.
