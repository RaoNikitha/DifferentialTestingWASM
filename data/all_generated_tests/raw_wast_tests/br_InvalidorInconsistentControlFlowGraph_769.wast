;; 10. **Improperly Nested Branch Test**: Construct a set of nested structures where a `br` instruction tries to branch to a label that improperly nests within another independent structure, such as misaligning an `if` blockâ€™s branch to a nested `loop`. This tests whether the implementation manages improper nesting violations.
