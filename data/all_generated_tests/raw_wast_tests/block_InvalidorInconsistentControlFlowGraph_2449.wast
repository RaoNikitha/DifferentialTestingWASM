;; 10. **Test Undetected Unreachable Block Section**:    - Description: Include a code segment within the block that is never reachable due to previous unconditional branches.    - Constraint: Verify that the implementation detects and handles unreachable code segments within blocks.    - CFG Relevance: Unreachable code should be identified to maintain a clean and accurate CFG without redundant or dead paths.
