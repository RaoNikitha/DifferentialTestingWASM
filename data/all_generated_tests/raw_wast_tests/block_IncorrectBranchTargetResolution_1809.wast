;; 10. **Test Sequential Blocks with Cross-targeted `br`**:    - Sequence of blocks containing `br` instructions that incorrectly target the next block.    - Ensures branching mechanism does not permit cross-targeting sequential block labels.    - Expected result: WebAssembly should cease execution due to cross-block target error, but wizard_engine might execute incorrectly.
