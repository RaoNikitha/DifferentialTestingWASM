;; 2. **Test Description:**    Include a `call_indirect` within a nested `loop` and contain br_table instruction that attempts to exit multiple levels of nesting to confirm if the jump targets are resolved correctly and do not cause unintended traps.    - **Constraint Checked:** Proper interpretation of nested loop boundaries.    - **Mismanagement Relation:** Ensures that the engine correctly manages loop exits without bugs in nested contexts.
