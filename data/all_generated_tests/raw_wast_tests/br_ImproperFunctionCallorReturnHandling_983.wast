;; 4. **Test: Function Call with Incorrect Stack Polymorphism**    - **Description**: Implement a test where a function is called after significant manipulation of the stack's state. Ensure the function tries to `br` to a label requiring certain operand types that were altered incorrectly before the call.    - **Constraint Checked**: Validates the stack state and polymorphism properties when handling function calls.    - **Improper Handling Aspect**: Failure to preserve the correct stack state across function calls resulting in invalid operands on the stack.
