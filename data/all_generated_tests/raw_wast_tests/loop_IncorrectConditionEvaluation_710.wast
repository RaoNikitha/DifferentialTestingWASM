;; 1. **Loop Execution with `br_if` Conditional Branch**    - Test a loop where the `br_if` condition is based on a stack value pushed by a sequence of instructions that ultimately results in `0`. The branch should not be taken, testing that the loop correctly handles the `br_if` condition.    - **Reason**: Ensures that `br_if` properly checks the top stack value and behaves correctly when the condition fails.
