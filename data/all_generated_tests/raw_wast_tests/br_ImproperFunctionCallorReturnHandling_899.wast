;; 10. **Branch from Catch Block with Function Call:**     - Description: Create a function with a `try-catch` block where the caught block contains a `br` instruction branching to a label outside the catch block after a function call. Validate the return value.     - Constraint: This test ensures the `br` instruction operates correctly within `try-catch` structures, properly handling operand stack unwinding and return values after catching exceptions.
