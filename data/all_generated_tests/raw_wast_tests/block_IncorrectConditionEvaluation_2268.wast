;; 9. **Test Description**: Implement a loop inside a block that performs conditional jumps using `br_if`, with conditions evaluated from iterative arithmetic operations within the loop body.    - **Constraint Checked**: Tests handling of iterative conditions and proper branching based on loop operations.    - **Relation to Condition Evaluation**: Errors in loop condition evaluations result in wrong branches and loop execution paths.
