;; 3. **Test Description**: Perform a series of `br` and `br_if` instructions within a block to sections of code that should not require certain stack depths or values, conditional on different branch conditions that are difficult to track manually.    - **Constraint**: Ensures branch instructions correctly unwind and manage the operand stack.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: If the branches do not correctly manage the stack, it could lead to accessing invalid stack data.
