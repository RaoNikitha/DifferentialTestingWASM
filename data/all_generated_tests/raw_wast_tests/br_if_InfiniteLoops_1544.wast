;; 5. **Test Description**: Implement a loop with a `br_if` instruction, combined with other stack-consuming operations. The test checks if `br_if` appropriately manages the operand stack as per constraints.    - **Constraint Checked**: Stack polymorphism and operand stack management.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: If the operand stack is mismanaged, the loop can operate on incorrect conditions, not breaking out and looping indefinitely.
