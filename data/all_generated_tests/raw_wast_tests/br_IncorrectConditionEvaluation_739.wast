;; 10. **Test Description:**     - Implement a `br_if` with a condition that utilizes a counter variable reset within a loop cycle. Test if breakpoint correctly updates based on real-time counter changes.     - **Constraint Checked:** Accurate end-of-cycle counter evaluation ensuring proper branch decisions.     - **Test Relation:** Ensures condition tied to cyclic counter variables triggers correct `br_if` branches.
