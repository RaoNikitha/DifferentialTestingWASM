;; 6. **Test Description**: Develop a loop that alternates between `br` and `br_if` instructions, using nested blocks within the loop. The `br_if` should test various conditions leading to a potential exit from the blocks and ultimately the loop.    **Constraint**: Validates the correct interpretation of block input/output types concerning backward branches.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Misinterpreting block types can cause `br_if` conditions to fail, resulting in loops running indefinitely.
