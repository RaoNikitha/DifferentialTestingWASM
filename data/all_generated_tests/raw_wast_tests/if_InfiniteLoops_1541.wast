;; 2. **Test Description**: An `if` block inside a `loop`, where the conditional evaluates a stack operand but includes an incorrect usage of labeled branches to exit multiple control structures.    **Constraint Checked**: Verifies correct handling of labeled branching and validation of stack operand usage.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: If the labels or operand stack are mismanaged, the intended loop exit may fail, causing an infinite loop.
