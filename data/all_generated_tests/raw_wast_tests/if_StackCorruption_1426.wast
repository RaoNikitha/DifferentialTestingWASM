;; 7. **Test Name: Deeply Nested Blocks with Stack Unwind Requirements**    - **Description**: Implement an `if` instruction within multiple nested `block` or `loop` which forces the stack to unwind extensively, ensuring all labels and stack states are properly maintained and referenced.      ```wasm      (block (block (block (i32.const 1) (if (result i32)             (block (i32.const 2) (loop (nop)))          else (nop)) end)))      ```    - **Reasoning**: Stress-tests the prohibition of stack corruption through unwinding of deep nested constructs within the `if`.
