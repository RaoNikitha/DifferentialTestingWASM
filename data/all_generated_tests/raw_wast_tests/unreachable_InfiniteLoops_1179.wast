;; 10. **Test Description:**    - Create a `loop` with a `call_indirect` instruction pointing to `unreachable`. This tests if indirectly called traps behave the same within loops.    - Constraint: Confirms `unreachable` behavior with indirect function calls within loops.    - Infinite Loop Relation: Ensures indirect traps prevent the loop from running indefinitely.
