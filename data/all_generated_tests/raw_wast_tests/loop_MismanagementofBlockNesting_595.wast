;; 6. **Forward and Backward Branching in Nested Contexts**:    - Test Description: Implement a case where nested loops involve both backward (to restart a loop) and forward branches (`br_table`) to various depths.    - Constraint: Focus on correct stack unwinding and branch target resolution ensuring accurate control flow transitions.    - Relation: This test checks for errors in multiple direction branching within nested loops, challenging the implementationâ€™s consistency in handling labels.
