;; 10. **Branch to End of Control Structure:**     Define `br_table` with labels pointing to the end marker of control structures.     - **Test Constraint:** `br_table` should properly branch to the end of structures.     - **Expected Differential:** WebAssembly should resolve correctly or trap, wizard_engine might misinterpret the end marker.
