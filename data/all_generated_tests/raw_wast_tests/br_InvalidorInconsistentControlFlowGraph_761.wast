;; 2. **Backward Branch Stack Unwinding Test**: Formulate a test where a `loop` has multiple instructions that manipulate the operand stack, and place a `br` instruction targeting the `loop`. Verify that the operand stack is correctly unwound to the height of the loop upon taking the backward branch. This ensures the implementation accurately handles stack unwinding for backward branches.
