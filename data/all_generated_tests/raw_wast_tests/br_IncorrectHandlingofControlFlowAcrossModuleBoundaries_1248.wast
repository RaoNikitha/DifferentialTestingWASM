;; 9. **Test Description:**    - Export a function utilizing diverse control flow constructs (`block`, `loop`, `if`) with strategically placed `br` instructions.    - Import and invoke this function, checking if the transitions handle stack and label indexing correctly.    - **Constraint:** Broadly test mixed control flow handling, particularly how branches interact when moved across module boundaries.
