;; 10. **Control Flow with Varying Type States**:    - Design a more complex control flow structure with mixed-type handling (`i32`, `f32`) and ensure the `return` instruction is met with the expected type despite transitions.    - **Constraint:** Validates the type state transitions through complex control flows fully comply with return types.    - **Type Mismatch:** Confirms that the intricate mix of types through control flow doesn't result in type mismatches at the return point.
