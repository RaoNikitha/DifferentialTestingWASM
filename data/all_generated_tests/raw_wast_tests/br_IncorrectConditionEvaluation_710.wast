;; 1. **Test: Incorrect Condition Handling for `br_if` with Zero Value**    - **Description:** Create a test where a `br_if` instruction is supposed to evaluate a condition that results in `0` (false). The `br_if` should not take the branch, and subsequent instructions should execute.    - **Constraint:** Ensure that the condition is correctly evaluated to `0`, and the `br_if` does not take the branch, verifying correct condition evaluation.
