;; 4. **Test Description**: Introduce a sequence of nested `block` structures where a `br_if` conditionally targets an intermediate block. Validate the proper block is exited and the operand stack matches post-exit expectations.    - **Constraint Checked**: Correct intermediate block exit and operand stack unwinding.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: Mismanagement could result in incorrect block exit or stack state.
