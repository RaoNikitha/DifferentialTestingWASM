;; 1. **Test with Incorrect Label Arity:**    - Description: Create a test where a `br_table` instruction references multiple labels of varying operand stack types and lengths.    - Constraint Checked: Consistent arity validation across all branch labels.    - Relates to Unreachable Code Execution: If `br_table` branches to a label with mismatched arity incorrectly, it may cause the incorrect stack configuration and lead to unintended execution of the `unreachable` instruction.
