;; 3. **Test with `loop` containing multiple `nop` instructions and a `br_table`**:    - **Constraint**: Verifies if `nop` interspersed with `br_table` in a loop control structure is properly handled.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: If `nop` alters the jump table or the control flow, the loop may not exit as intended, leading to an infinite loop.
