;; 10. **Deferred Unreachable via Block Exit in Loop**:     - **Description**: Implement a loop encapsulating a block where a `br` from within the block leads to an unreachable at the loopâ€™s end.     - **Constraint Checked**: Tests the handling of block exits leading to unreachable instructions within loop constructs.     - **Unreachable Execution Check**: Ensures deferred unreachable instructions at block exits within loops correctly cause traps.
