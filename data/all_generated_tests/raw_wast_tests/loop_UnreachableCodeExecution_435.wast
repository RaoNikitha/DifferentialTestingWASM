;; 6. **Test Description**: Design a loop with improperly typed return values that does not match the loop's block type, making the mismatched path contain an `unreachable`.    - **Constraint**: Validates the function type handling and consistency of return types with block types.    - **Unreachable Code Execution**: Mismatched return types must trap before they lead to paths containing `unreachable`.
