;; 3. **Test Description:** Implement a `block` containing a `loop` and use `br_if` incorrectly within the `block` to test label targeting.     - **Constraint Checked:** Checks for correct branching and label indexing.     - **Infinite Loop Relation:** Incorrect label targeting can cause the `br_if` to fail, resulting in a loop that never exits.
