;; 2. **Backward Branch with Operand Stack:**    Construct a loop with specific operand stack requirements and use the `br` instruction to jump back to the starting point of the loop. Ensure the operand stack is managed correctly and does not encounter an `unreachable` instruction due to improper operand handling or misinterpreted label index.
