;; 2. **Test with Single Out-of-Bound Target**:    - A `block` containing a `br_table` instruction with a single target index that is out of bounds.    - This tests if `br_table` correctly identifies and responds to an out-of-bound index, ensuring it checks the label indices properly.    - Edge Case: Wizard_engine's `ctl_stack` might not correctly handle out-of-bound indices under state management.
