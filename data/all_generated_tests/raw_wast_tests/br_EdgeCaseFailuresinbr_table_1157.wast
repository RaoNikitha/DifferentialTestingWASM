;; 8. **Test Description**: A loop containing a `br_table` where the index varies based on dynamic calculations, potentially leading to out-of-range indices during certain iterations.    - **Constraint Checked**: Correct handling of dynamically changing indices during loop execution.    - **Edge Case Relation**: Exposes differential behavior when indices within loops are calculated on-the-fly and occasionally out of bounds.
