;; 3. **Test Loop with Mismatched Operand Types:**    - **Description:** Implement a loop with operand types that don't match the expected operands when executed with `br`.    - **Reasoning:** This ensures operand stack management correctly matches expected input types.    - **Constraint:** Adhere to operand stack management rules and ensure matching operand types.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption:** Mismatched operand types cause improper stack restoration, potentially leading to underflows, overflows, or corrupted data on subsequent operations.
