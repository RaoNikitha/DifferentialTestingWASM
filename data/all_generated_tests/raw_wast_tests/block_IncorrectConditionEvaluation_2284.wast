;; 5. **Negated Condition**:    - Inside a block, test a negated condition (`i32.const 1`, `i32.eqz`, `br_if 0`) to branch conditionally. Verify if the negation results in correct branching decision.        Constraints: Checks if negating conditions (`eqz`) properly influence the branch decision taken by `br_if`.
