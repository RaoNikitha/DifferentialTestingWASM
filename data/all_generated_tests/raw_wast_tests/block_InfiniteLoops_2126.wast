;; 7. **Missing `end` within Complex Loop**:    - **Test Description**: Implement a complex loop with conditional blocks where an `end` instruction is missed, thus looping infinitely.    - **Constraint**: Ensuring all the blocks inside the loop are correctly bracketed by `end` instructions.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Missing `end` instructions keep the control flow trapped in a loop.
