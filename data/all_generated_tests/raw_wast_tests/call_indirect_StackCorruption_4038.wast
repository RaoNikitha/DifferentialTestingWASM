;; 7. **Recursive Calls with Mismatched Returns**:    - Implement a sequence of recursive `call_indirect` where the return type does not match the expected function signature.    - Constraint Check: Verify if returns are properly managed and validated during recursion.    - Stack Corruption Relation: Incorrect return types can lead to incorrect values being left on the stack, resulting in subsequent calls failing.
