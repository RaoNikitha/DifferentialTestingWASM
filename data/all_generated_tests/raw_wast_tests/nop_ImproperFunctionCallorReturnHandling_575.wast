;; 6. **Test Description**: Formulate a scenario where a function with `nop` instructions is called repeatedly, both directly and indirectly. Ensure the accumulation or modification of state by subsequent function calls is not disrupted.    - **Constraint Checked**: Validates repeated direct and indirect calls.    - **Relation to Improper Handling**: Mismanaged `nop` could disrupt the correct state propagation across calls.
