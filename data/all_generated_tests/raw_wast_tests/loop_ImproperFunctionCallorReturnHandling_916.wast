;; 7. **Test: Loop and Recursive Function Calls**     - Description: Implement a loop instruction that calls a recursive function. The function should include a base case to terminate recursion. Verify that the recursive function handles proper return values and does not cause infinite loops.     - Constraint: Ensures recursive calls are correctly returned within loop blocks, verifying stack and control flow integrity.
