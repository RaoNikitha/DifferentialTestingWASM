;; 2. **Conditional Branch to Unreachable After Loop**:    - **Description**: Design a loop where a conditionally executed branch (`br_if 0`) can lead to an unreachable instruction right after the loop.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures conditional branches do not bypass unreachable checks when exiting loops.    - **Unreachable Execution Check**: Verifies that the conditional branch executes correctly and traps at the unreachable instruction if taken.
