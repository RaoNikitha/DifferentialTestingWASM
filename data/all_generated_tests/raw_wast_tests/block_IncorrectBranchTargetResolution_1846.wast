;; 7. **Incorrect Branch Target with Mismatched Types**:    - Construct a block structure where the `blocktype` dictates specific stack types, and attempt a `br` instruction targeting a label with mismatched expected types. Validate proper error handling or incorrect execution if types mismatch is incorrectly allowed.    - **Constraint**: Branching should respect the operand stack types specified by the target blocktype.    - **Focus**: Tests type-checking enforcement during branch resolution.
