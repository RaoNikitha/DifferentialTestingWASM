;; 8. **Test Description**: Integrate a sequence where a loop wraps around a `nop` and a conditionally branching `br` that should exit the loop based on passed iteration count.    - **Constraint**: Ensures that `nop` does not interfere with correct iteration counting.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Checks if the loop stops correctly after specified iterations, without `nop` causing infinite loops.
