;; 10. **Test 10**: Implement control flow with mixed types, where `br_if` instructions rely on popping mixed-type operands. Manage a profile where conditional branching to `unreachable` occurs based on type checks, ensuring correct operand management across value types and preventing misinterpretation leading to `unreachable`.
