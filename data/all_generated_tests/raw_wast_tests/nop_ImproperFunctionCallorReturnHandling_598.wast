;; 9. **Test Name: No-Operation with Indirect Function Call Validation**    - **Description**: Add protective `nop` instructions around `call_indirect` to validate proper call table implementation.    - **Constraint**: Ensure that indirect calls resolve correctly despite the presence of `nop`.    - **Improper Handling Check**: Ensures `nop` does not affect the indirect call lookup or execution.    - **Expected Behavior**: Indirect call resolution and execution remain identical across both implementations.
