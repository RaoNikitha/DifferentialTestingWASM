;; 4. **Test Description:** Employ the `br_table` instruction to branch backward into a loop, verifying that the operand stack state is correctly managed and matched against the loopâ€™s entry requirements.    - **Constraint Checked:** Correct stack management and operand type matching for backward branches.    - **Relation to Incorrect Branch Target Resolution:** Incorrect stack state could cause invalid branches.
