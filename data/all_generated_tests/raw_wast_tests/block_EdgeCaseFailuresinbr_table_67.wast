;; 8. **Test with `br_table` Directly Followed by another `block`**:    - `br_table` appearing at the end of a `block` immediately preceding another `block`.    - Ensures that label resolution and branching correctly recognize the context end points even at block boundaries.    - Edge Case: Wizard_engineâ€™s state management functions might not correctly resume execution past boundary points, leading to incorrect behavior.
