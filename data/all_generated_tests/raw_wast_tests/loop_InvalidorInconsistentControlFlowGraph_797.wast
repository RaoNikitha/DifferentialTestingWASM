;; 8. **Recursive Loop with Invalid Type Inversion**:     - **Description**: Design a recursive loop that inverts operand types in branches back to the loop header, checking if reinitialized types conform to loop declarations.     - **Constraint**: Type validation and operand consistency in recursive loops.     - **CFG Impact**: Type mismatches in recursive loops alter expected execution paths causing CFG inconsistencies.
