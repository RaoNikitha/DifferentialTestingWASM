;; 3. **Test: Backward Branch to Loop with Excess Operands**:    - **Description**: Define a loop with `br_if` attempting to branch back to the loop start while having more operands than required by the loop's input signature.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures that the loop's input signature correctly dictates the number of operands needed.    - **Relation to Incorrect Branch Target Resolution**: Verifies that excessive operands don't cause the branch to resolve incorrectly, maintaining the correct control flow.
