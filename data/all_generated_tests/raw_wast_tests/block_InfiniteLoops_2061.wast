;; 2. **Test Description:** Define a nested `block` structure with an incorrect block type (`valtype?` used incorrectly), causing type mismatch.     - **Constraint Checked:** Verifies proper `blocktype` verification and type matching.     - **Infinite Loop Relation:** Mismatched block types can cause incorrect stack operations, potentially leading to unresolvable states and infinite loops.
