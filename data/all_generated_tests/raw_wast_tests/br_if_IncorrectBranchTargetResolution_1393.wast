;; 4. **Test: Forward Branch to Block with Insufficient Operands**:    - **Description**: Create a block structure where `br_if` aims to branch forward to a block with less than needed operands on the stack.    - **Constraint Checked**: Validates that the target block's output type dictates the required operands on the stack.    - **Relation to Incorrect Branch Target Resolution**: Checks that the engine correctly prevents invalid branch resolutions due to a lack of operands, ensuring accurate control flow maintenance.
