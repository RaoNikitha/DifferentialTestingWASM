;; 8. **Test: Loop with Call to Exported Function Modifying Local Stack**    Description: Construct a loop that calls an exported function which modifies its local operand stack. Ensure that the control flow resumes correctly within the loop and the operand stack is properly synchronized.    Constraints:    - Verify consistent stack handling between loop and function.    - Ensure correct function signature for stack modification.    - Validate resumption of loop execution with synchronized stack.
