;; 1. **Test Description**: A loop containing a `br_if` instruction that should conditionally break out based on a stack-supplied boolean value. Ensure the loop exits early if the condition is false.    - **Constraint**: Verifies the condition evaluation in `br_if` accurately decides whether to break the loop.    - **Differential Behavior**: The loop continues to run in one engine despite the condition being false.
