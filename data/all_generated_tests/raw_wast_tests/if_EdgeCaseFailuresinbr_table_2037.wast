;; 8. **Test Name: `br_table` in Infinite Loop Construct**    - **Description**: Encapsulate an `if` with a `br_table` within a loop that theoretically may never exit. This tests if such infinite loops are managed in a way that doesnâ€™t break the engine.    - **Constraint Checked**: Handling of infinite loops with internal conditional `br_table`.    - **Relation to Edge Case**: Ensures memory management and control flow integrity with potentially runaway loops.
