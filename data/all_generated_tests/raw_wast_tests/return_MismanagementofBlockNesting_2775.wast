;; 4. **Test Description:**    - Implement a function with a nested block containing a `br_table` instruction that jumps to different blocks and has `return` in one of the target blocks.    - Ensure different blocks stack heights are distinct.    - This validates whether the `return` within a `br_table` correctly exits from the function rather than the br_tableâ€™s immediate blocks.    - **Specific Constraint:** Mismanagement of `br_table` induced block depth when encountering `return`.
