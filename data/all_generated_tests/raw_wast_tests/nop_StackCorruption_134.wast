;; 5. **Test Description**:     Implement a sequence of stack manipulation operations (e.g., `push`, `pop`, `dup`) interspersed with `nop` instructions. Validate that the resulting stack state is accurate.    **Constraint**: `nop` should not interfere with direct stack manipulation instructions.    **Reasoning**: Ensures stack operations remain precise and corruption-free even with `nop` interspersed.
