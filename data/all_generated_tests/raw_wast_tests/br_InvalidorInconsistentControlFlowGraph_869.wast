;; 10. **Incorrect Forward Jumps to Non-Terminating Blocks:**    - Test forward branches that directly transition to non-terminating blocks or `if` instructions incorrectly.    - **Constraint Checked:** Correct end of the `block` or `if` targets ensuring proper branching.    - **CFG Impact:** Incorrect forward branches lead to CFG paths that might form invalid routes and unreachable states.
