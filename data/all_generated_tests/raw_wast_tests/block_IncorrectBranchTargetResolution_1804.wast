;; 5. **Test Block with `br_if` Targeting Invalid Index**:    - Within a block, place a `br_if` that targets a non-existent label index.    - This tests conditional branch target resolution.    - Expected result: WebAssembly must throw an error for the invalid index, whereas wizard_engine might proceed with unintended behavior.
