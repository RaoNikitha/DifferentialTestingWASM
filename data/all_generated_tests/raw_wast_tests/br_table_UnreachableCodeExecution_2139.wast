;; 9. **Test with Branch to Unintended Block:**    - Description: Create a scenario where `br_table` is misdirected due to incorrect label target setups resulting in an attempt to branch into a block that wasn't intended.    - Constraint Checked: Control flow constraints ensuring correct exit or loop back within structured instructions.    - Relates to Unreachable Code Execution: Incorrect branch targets can lead to unintended code paths ending with the `unreachable` instruction.
