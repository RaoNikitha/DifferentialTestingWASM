;; 10. **Test Case 10: Randomized `nop` insertions in valid instruction sequence leading to `unreachable`:**     - **Constraint Checked:** Ensuring random `nop` placements do not disrupt the valid execution path.     - **Expected Behavior:** Despite random `nop` placements, should eventually hit `unreachable` to trap.     - **Differential Behavior:** Wizard_engineâ€™s initialization context mismanagement might lead to unexpected execution behaviors.
