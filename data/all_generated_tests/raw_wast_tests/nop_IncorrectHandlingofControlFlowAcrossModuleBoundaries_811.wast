;; 2. **Test Description**: Construct a WebAssembly module with an exported function that contains nested control flow structures (e.g., `block`, `loop`) interspersed with `nop` instructions. Ensure that a different module can import and call this function without any control flow issues or stack corruption due to incorrectly handled `nop` instructions.
