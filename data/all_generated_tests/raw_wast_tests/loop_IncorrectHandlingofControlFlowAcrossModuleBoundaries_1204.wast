;; 5. **Test 5**:    - Description: Construct a loop that re-invokes the calling function through an exported function after a looping backward branch, verifying the operand stackâ€™s consistency.    - Specific Constraint: Ensures the operand stack is correctly unwound and reconstructed during re-entrant function calls.    - Control Flow Relation: Checks for stack consistency in re-entrant function calls across module boundaries.
