;; 6. **Test Description:**    - Implement `br_if` in a sequence of blocks where the condition depends on stack-argument manipulation (push-pop operations). Test branches under specific stack modifications.    - **Constraint Checked:** Correct evaluation of conditions influenced by dynamic stack operations.    - **Test Relation:** Ensures that even with complex operand stack manipulations, conditional branching adheres to correct conditions.
