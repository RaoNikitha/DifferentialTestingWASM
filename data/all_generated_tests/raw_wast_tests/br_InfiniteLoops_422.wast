;; 3. **Test Description:**    - Design a test with a loop structure where `br` targets the same nested loop repeatedly. The condition for an exit should be embedded within a calculation that frequently changes.     - **Constraint:** This test aims to ensure the branch behaves correctly, like a `continue` statement, and does not create an infinite loop with incorrect operand handling or label lookup errors.
