;; 4. **Multiple `br_if` Conditions with Return**:    - Design a function with multiple `br_if` conditions that modify control flow based on stack values, followed by a return instruction. Test to ensure the correct path is returned from.    - **Reasoning**: Checks for incorrect condition evaluations affecting return behavior, ensuring proper stack type consistency and operand handling.
