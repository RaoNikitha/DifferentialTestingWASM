;; 3. **Test for Maximum Number of Branches in 'br_table' with Call Invocation**:    - Check the behavior when 'br_table' is given the maximum allowable branches, followed by multiple function calls.    - Implement 'br_table' with maximum branches possible and an index near its boundary leading to valid 'call' instructions.    - This ensures the handling of the largest 'br_table' by both implementations and verifies correct index resolution.
