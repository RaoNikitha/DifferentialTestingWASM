;; 10. **Loop with Span of Return Points**:     Design a loop containing multiple segments where each segment conditionally performs a `return` based on the stackâ€™s operand values or register states. This tests the handling of `return` from within the loop, ensuring no overlooked or incorrectly targeted returns cause the function to loop infinitely.
