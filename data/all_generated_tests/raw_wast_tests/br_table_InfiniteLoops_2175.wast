;; 5. **Test 5**: Develop a loop where `br_table` indexes into a dynamic list of labels, including some targets that lead back to the start of the loop. Ensure the dynamic nature of the operand is handled correctly.    - **Constraint**: Validates operand dynamicity and correct default label usage.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Incorrect default target handling can cause the loop to run indefinitely.
