;; 9. **Incorrect Operand Handling**:    - Description: Test with an operand stack thatâ€™s manipulated in a way which mismatches the expected operand stack configuration exactly when the branch leads to `unreachable`.    - Constraint: Checks correct stack unwinding and operand reconfiguration upon branching.    - Relation: Incorrect stack handling pre-branch might immediately lead to `unreachable` when intended paths are unhandled.
