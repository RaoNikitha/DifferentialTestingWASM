;; 2. **Test 2**:    - Description: Design a loop that includes a conditional branch (`br_if`) to a label within the same function, which in turn calls an imported function. Verify if the operand stack is correctly handled across the function call.    - Specific Constraint: The `br_if` should correctly unwind the stack up to the loopâ€™s entry height.    - Control Flow Relation: Ensures conditional branching within loops handles transitions between modules correctly.
