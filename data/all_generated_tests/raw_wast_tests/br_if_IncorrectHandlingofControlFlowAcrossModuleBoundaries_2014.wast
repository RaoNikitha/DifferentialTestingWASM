;; 5. **Test Description:** Have a `br_if` instruction within a block that calls an imported function which conditionally throws an exception, triggering stack unwinding.    **Constraint Checked:** Correct operand stack unwinding consistent with label type across module boundary exceptions.    **Relation:** Examines the consistency of stack unwinding and label handling when exceptions are involved across module boundaries.
