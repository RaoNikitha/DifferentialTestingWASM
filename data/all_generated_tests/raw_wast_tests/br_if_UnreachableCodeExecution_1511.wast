;; 2. **Test 2 - Empty Operand Stack Before `br_if`**:    Create a code snippet where a `br_if` operation is executed with an empty operand stack, causing the operation to expect operand(s) that are not present. The wizard_engine should detect this and raise an `EmptyValueStackExpecting` error. This tests the constraint that requires operands to be present.
