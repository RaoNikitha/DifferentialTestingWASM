;; 7. **Inconsistent Stack Height after Branching**:    - **Test Description**: Inside a block, use branch instructions that leave the operand stack in an erroneous state, either under or overflowing from what the block type specifies.    - **Reasoning**: This test involves checking that the CFG correctly manages the stack height during and after branching within blocks.    - **Constraint checked**: Branching Mechanisms    - **Relation to CFG**: Validates that the CFG correctly maintains stack states through branches.
