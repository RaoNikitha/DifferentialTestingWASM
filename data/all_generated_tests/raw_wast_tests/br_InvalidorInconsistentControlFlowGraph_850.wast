;; 1. **Test Description:** Create a deeply nested structure with multiple `block`, `loop`, and `if` constructs. Use the `br` instruction intending to break to a high-level enclosing `block`. The test should check if the WebAssembly implementation properly interprets the label index and manages the operand stack correctly, whereas the wizard_engine might fail due to incorrect label argument handling.
