;; 3. **Test Description**: A nested `loop` and `if` structure where the `br_if` conditionally branches to a label in an outer block but within the deepest loop.    - **Constraint Checked**: Verifies conditional branching respects nested structural boundaries.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: Mismanagement may allow the `br_if` to incorrectly resolve labels, affecting flow control.
