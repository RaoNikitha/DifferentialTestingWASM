;; 8. **Test 8**:    - **Description**: A `call` instruction nested within a block where the block is interrupted by a `br` instruction, causing a jump to different depths of nesting.    - **Constraint Checked**: Checks if stack operations and types are preserved through block interruption and jumps.    - **Relation to Block Nesting**: Tests control flow management and stack correctness with `br` instructions affecting nested blocks.
