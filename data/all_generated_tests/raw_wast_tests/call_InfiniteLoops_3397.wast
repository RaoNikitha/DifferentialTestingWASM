;; 6. **Test Description**: Formulate a test with a loop containing a function call that utilizes a local counter. A `br` instruction inside this function should terminate the loop when the counter surpasses a specific value set outside the loop.    - **Constraint**: Accurate local counter updates and correct loop-breaking using `br`.    - **Infinite Loop Relation**: Failure in counter update or `br` instruction would keep the loop running indefinitely.
