;; 5. **Test Description**: Define a loop with a `br_table` that indirectly jumps out of the loop based on an out-of-bounds index that leads directly to an `unreachable`.    - **Constraint**: Ensures indirect branching via `br_table` handles index bounds appropriately within loops.    - **Unreachable Code Execution**: Incorrect handling of `br_table` bounds could lead to unintended jumps to `unreachable`.
