;; 2. **Test with Mismatched Operand Stack Height**:    - Implement a function where the block expects two values on the operand stack (`i32` and `f32`), but only provide one value (`i32`) before invoking `return`.    - **Constraint:** Verifies the stack height and type consistency when `return` is used.    - **Type Mismatch:** Tests the adherence to operand stack requirements within control flow blocks.
