;; 10. **Blocks Mixed with Unreachable and Multiple Br_instructions:**    - Design blocks mixed with `unreachable` and various `br` instructions targeting outer blocks. This ensures that the `br` instructions do not mismanage the nested block exits upon encountering `unreachable` first, resulting in consistent trapping behavior.  Each of these tests aims to check for mismanagement of block nesting in scenarios involving the `unreachable` instruction, ensuring that the flow control is correctly handled and traps are consistently triggered across different implementations.
