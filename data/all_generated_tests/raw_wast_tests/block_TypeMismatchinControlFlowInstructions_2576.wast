;; 7. **Test Description**:    Design a `block` that produces a float (`f32`) but insert a branch (`br`) that erroneously restores an `i32` after unwinding the block. Verify type mismatch detection.    **Constraint**: Restored stack after a branch must respect block type constraints.    **Relation**: Ensures runtime branches uphold consistent type constraints.
