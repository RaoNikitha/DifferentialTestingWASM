;; 8. **Test Description:**    A `loop` that repeatedly evaluates a `br_if` condition based on a decrementing counter. When the counter reaches zero, the condition should be false, and the loop should continue. Test ensures the loop continues correctly and `br_if` only branches when the condition is true.    - **Constraint:** Validates `br_if` with decremental conditional evaluation within a loop.
