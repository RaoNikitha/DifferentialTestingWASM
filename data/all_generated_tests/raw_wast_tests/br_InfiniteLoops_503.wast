;; 4. **Test Description:**    - Create a scenario in which a `br` instruction targets a label that is not within the valid bounds of the loop's nesting structure.    - **Constraint Checking:** Verifies if the implementation correctly checks for the validity of target labels within the nesting structure.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops:** An invalid target label may cause the loop to miss its exit condition, resulting in an infinite loop.
