;; 5. **Test Description**:    Position `nop` before and after a label and corresponding br instruction. Check if branching operates correctly without causing stack corruption.    **Constraint Checked**: Validates `nop` doesn't affect branching mechanics or stack state.    **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Incorrect `nop` handling could result in mismanagement of branching, leading to stack misalignment.
