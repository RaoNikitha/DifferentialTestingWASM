;; 5. **Test: Br_if Inside Nested Structures with Unreachable**    - **Description:** Implement nested `block` and `loop` structures with conditional branches (`br_if`) and an `unreachable` instruction within them. Add branches dependent on stack values provided by other instructions.    - **Constraint Checked:** Tests the interaction between stack-dependent branches and `unreachable` in nested contexts.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting:** Ensures that stack-based flow control handles nested block contexts and unreachable instructions correctly.
