;; 1. **Test `br_if` with Simple True Condition:**    - A conditional branch `br_if` with a simple condition that evaluates to true. Check if the branch is taken correctly in both implementations.     - Constraint Checked: Correct evaluation of the true condition in `br_if`.    - Relation: Ensures `br_if` branches correctly when condition is true.
