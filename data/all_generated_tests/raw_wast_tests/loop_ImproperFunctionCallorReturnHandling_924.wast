;; 5. **Test Case**: Introduce a loop with conditionally branched `call` instructions (using `br_if`), where calls are dependent on loop-variant conditions.    - **Constraint Check**: Check for correct branching and function calling based on dynamic conditions.    - **Improper Function Call or Return Handling**: Mismanagement of conditional function calls based on loop conditions.
