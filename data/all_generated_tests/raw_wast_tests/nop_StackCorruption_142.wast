;; 3. **Test Description**:    Place multiple consecutive `nop` instructions within a block that performs arithmetic operations. Verify the stack state remains consistent through the sequence of `nop` instructions.    **Constraint Checked**: Confirms multiple `nop`s consecutively do not affect the stack.    **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Improper handling could lead to stack underflows or type mismatches in subsequent operations.
