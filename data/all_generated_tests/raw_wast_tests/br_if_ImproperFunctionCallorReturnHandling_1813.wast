;; 4. **Test Description:** Implement a `call` instruction within a loop that uses `br_if` to conditionally exit. Ensure that the loop iterates correctly when the `br_if` condition is false, and returns to the start of the loop when conditionally breaking out.    - **Constraint:** Checks for the loop's backward jump to function properly.    - **Improper Handling:** Mismanagement of stack and control flow within loops with function calls.
