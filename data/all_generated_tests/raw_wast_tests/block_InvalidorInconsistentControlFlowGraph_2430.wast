;; 1. **Test for Missing `end` Instruction**:    - Create a `block` instruction that lacks a matching `end` instruction at the end of the block. This will test how the implementation handles improperly nested instructions.    - Constraint: Ensuring well-nested blocks.    - CFG Impact: Incorrect CFG due to prematurely terminated blocks leading to potential branch misalignment.
