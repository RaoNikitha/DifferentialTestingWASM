;; 2. **Test Description**: Set up a loop with a `br_if` that conditionally breaks out based on a counter variable. Ensure the counter is properly checked against zero. The test should check proper unwinding of the operand stack when targeting loop labels.    - **Constraint Checked**: Operand stack unwinding and condition evaluation.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Incorrect stack unwinding or condition check may cause the loop to continue infinitely without exiting.
