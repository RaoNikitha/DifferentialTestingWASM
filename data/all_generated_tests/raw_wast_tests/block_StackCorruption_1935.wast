;; 6. **Test Description**: Create a test where a `block` is prematurely ended with an `end` instruction but without consuming the required stack operands specified as input by the `blocktype`.    - **Constraint Checked**: Validates enforcement of block scope and operand stack alignment upon block termination.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Improper block termination and operand misalignment can leave the stack in a corrupted state, affecting following instructions.
