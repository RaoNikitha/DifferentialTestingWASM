;; 9. **Test Description**:    Place `nop` within a recursive function that modifies the stack with operand values and returns. Check the stack state after each recursive call to ensure consistency.    **Constraint Checked**: Ensures `nop` within recursion doesnâ€™t corrupt the stack.    **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Recursive stack operations are vulnerable to corruption if `nop` is mismanaged.
