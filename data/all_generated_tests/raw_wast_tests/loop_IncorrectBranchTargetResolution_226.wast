;; 7. **Test for Multi-Layer Nested Loops with Labels**:    Develop deeply nested loops with branches at various levels. Each loop should have a unique `typeidx`, and the test ascertains if `br` and `br_if` correctly resolve labels deep within nested layers. This checks the consistent resolution of nested loop branches.
