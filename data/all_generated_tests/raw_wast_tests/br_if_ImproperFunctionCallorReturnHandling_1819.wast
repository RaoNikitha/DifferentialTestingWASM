;; 10. **Test Description:** Implement a `br_if` directly followed by a `call` instruction, triggering a function indirectly. The conditionally skipped function must confirm proper function was called or not.    - **Constraint:** Ensures conditionally skipping `call` with `br_if` is handled accurately.    - **Improper Handling:** Misalignment between the branch being taken and the subsequent call instruction execution.
