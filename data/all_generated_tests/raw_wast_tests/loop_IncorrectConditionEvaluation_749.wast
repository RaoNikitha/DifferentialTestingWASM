;; 10. **Test Description**: Use a sequence of multiple `br_if` conditions within a loop to create a decision tree. Ensure the loop navigates the tree correctly based on each evaluated condition.    - **Constraint**: Validate conditional branching throughout multiple `br_if` instructions.    - **Incorrect Condition Evaluation**: This test evaluates handling sequences of branch conditions, checking for branching errors due to condition misjudgments.
