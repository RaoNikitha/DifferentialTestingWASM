;; 5. **Test Description**: Create a loop containing a sequence of `br` instructions, with `br` targeting labels in a specific order, causing complete stack unwind if implemented correctly and includes an external counter. Ensure the counter logic is respected to end loop execution.    **Constraint**: Checks operand stack management and correct restoration of operand states.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: If operands are not correctly managed, the intended loop exit condition may never be met.
