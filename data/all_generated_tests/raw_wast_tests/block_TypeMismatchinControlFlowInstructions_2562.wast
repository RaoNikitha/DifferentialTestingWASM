;; 3. **Test Description**:    Create a `block` that references a `valtype?` but includes instructions producing a different type, ensuring that the discrepancy is caught by the type checker.    **Constraint:** Checking if the instructions within the block conform to the expected type.    **Relation to Type Mismatch:** Examines adherence to stack type requirements within the control flow.
