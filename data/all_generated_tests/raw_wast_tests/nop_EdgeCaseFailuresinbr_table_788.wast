;; 9. **Test Description**: Include a `br_table` that targets multiple nested blocks. Precede block definitions and nested block invocations with `nop` instructions.     - **Constraint Checked**: Confirm `nop` placements within and around blocks don't alter index-based branching execution.     - **Edge Case Relation**: Nested control structures should manage indices appropriately, with `nop` being inert.
