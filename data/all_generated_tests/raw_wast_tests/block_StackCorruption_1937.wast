;; 8. **Test Description**: Define a `block` where the instruction set inside the block pushes more elements onto the stack than the blockâ€™s `blocktype` specifies as output.    - **Constraint Checked**: Checks for correct enforcement of block type's output arity regarding stack state.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Over-pushing elements can pollute the stack with unwanted values, leading to stack overflow or corruption outside the block scope.
