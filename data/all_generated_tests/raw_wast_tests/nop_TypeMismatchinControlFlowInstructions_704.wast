;; 5. **Test for `nop` before Conditional Branching with `br_if`**:    - **Description**: Place `nop` before a `br_if` instruction and define checks for type integrity before and after the branching.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures type and stack consistency during conditional branching.    - **Relation**: Checks whether `nop` affects the validation of stack state leading to incorrect type assumptions during `br_if` execution.
