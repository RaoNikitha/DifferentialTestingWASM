;; 10. **Test 10: Nested Control Structures with Parallel Branches**    - Nested control structures (`block`, `loop`, `if`) with multiple `br` instructions targeting the same level from different paths.    - Constraint: Ensure that simultaneous branches to the same target label are handled correctly.    - Stack Corruption Check: Validate that parallel branches maintain stack integrity without causing inconsistencies.
