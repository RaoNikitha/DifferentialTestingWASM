;; 7. **Test: Conditional Branching with Operand Stack Manipulations**    - **Description:** Construct a test where `br_if` conditions depend on prior stack manipulations (e.g., pushing and popping values). The conditions should be dynamically evaluated based on current stack state.    - **Constraint:** Ensure that stack manipulations do not affect the correctness of condition evaluations in `br_if`, verifying integral operand stack handling.
