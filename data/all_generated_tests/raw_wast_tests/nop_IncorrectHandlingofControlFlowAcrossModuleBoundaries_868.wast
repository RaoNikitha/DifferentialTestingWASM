;; 9. **Test: Cross-Module Nop Between Control Flow Branches**    - Set up Module A to export a function containing branches with each branch starting or ending with `nop`. Module B imports and tests this function for accurate branch execution and stack state.    - **Constraint Check**: Verifies `nop` does not disturb correct branching control flow across module boundaries.    - **Relation to Differential Handling**: Incorrect branching influenced by initialization problems in wizard_engine.
