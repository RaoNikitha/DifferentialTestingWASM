;; 10. **Duplicated Labels in Mixed Control Instructions**:    - Create a control flow with mixed instructions (`block`, `loop`, `if`) where labels are duplicated. Evaluate that branches resolve correctly to the intended instruction associated with those labels under mixed contexts.    - **Constraint**: Confirm context-awareness in resolving labels with duplicated indices amidst varied control instructions.
