;; 4. **Test Description**:     - Create a loop where a `br_if` is executed with the condition derived from computations and checks against results type.    - **Constraint Checking**: Validates correct computation and evaluation within the loop stack state, confirming operand handling.    - **Infinite Loop Relation**: Prevents scenarios where the condition always evaluates incorrectly, causing infinite loops due to improper evaluation and stack handling.
