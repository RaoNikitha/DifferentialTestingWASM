;; 4. Construct a WebAssembly module (`Module A`) with a block containing an `unreachable` followed by an instruction. Export the function and import it into another module (`Module B`). Invoke the function from `Module B` and ensure that the call leads to a trap early within the block, validating correct control flow across the modules.
