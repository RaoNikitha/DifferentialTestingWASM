;; 7. **Test Description**: Create a large WebAssembly function in Module A consisting of multiple `nop` instructions dispersed among a mixture of `call` instructions to both imported and exported functions. Ensure that `nop` instructions do not affect the execution order and control flow transitions when functions are called across modules.

 ;; (module
  (import "env" "external_func" (func $external_func))
  (func (export "main")
    (nop)
    (nop)
    (call $external_func)
    (nop)
    (call 0)
    (nop)
    (nop)
