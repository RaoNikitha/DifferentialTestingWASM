;; 3. **Test 3: Conditional Branch in Exported Function**    - **Description**: Define a WASM module that exports a function containing a `br_if` instruction within a block structure. Call this exported function from another module and ensure the conditionally controlled exit from the block is appropriately processed across boundary transitions.
