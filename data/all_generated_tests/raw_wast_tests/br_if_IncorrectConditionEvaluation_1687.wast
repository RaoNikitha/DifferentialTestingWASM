;; 8. **Test Description:** Test using floating point value simulations by converting them to integer conditions for `br_if` evaluations, ensuring conversions correctly influence branching.    - **Specific Constraint:** Examine branching based on converted and interpreted stack values.    - **Relation to Incorrect Condition Evaluation:** Checks if condition evaluation handles type conversions accurately.
