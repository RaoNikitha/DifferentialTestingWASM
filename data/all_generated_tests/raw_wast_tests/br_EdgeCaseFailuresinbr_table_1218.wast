;; 9. **Test Description**: Use a `br_table` nested within multiple `loop` constructs, with an index leading to a valid label and another, well outside the nested `loop` depth.    - **Constraint**: It assesses if the `br_table` correctly handles branching within deeply nested loops and manages invalid deep labels.    - **Edge Case Relation**: Tests deep nested control flows mixed with invalid deep target indices.
