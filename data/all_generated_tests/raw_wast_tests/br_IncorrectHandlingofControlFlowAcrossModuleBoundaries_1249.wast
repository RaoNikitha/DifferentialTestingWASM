;; 10. **Test Description:**    - Define and export a function with deeply nested blocks involving `br` instructions that interact with separately defined control structures in an imported context.    - Import and execute the function, verifying that deeply nested labels and control transfers respect structured control rules without stack corruption.    - **Constraint:** Test nested label indexing and operand stack unwinding deeply, specifically looking for edge cases in complex nested setups across module boundaries.
