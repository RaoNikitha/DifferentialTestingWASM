;; 6. **Test Description**:    - **Scenario**: An imported function containing a loop which uses `br_if` to conditionally jump back to the start, called from another module.    - **Constraint**: Ensure the continuation to the loopâ€™s entry is properly handled, with the correct operand stack state.    - **Differential Focus**: Compare the outcomes of explicit vs. implicit management of loop parameters in both WASM and wizard_engine.
