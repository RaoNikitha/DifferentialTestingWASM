;; 7. **Test 7**: Set up a loop that uses `br_table` to branch based on an operand exceeding the label index range. Ensure the default label leads out of the loop correctly.    - **Constraint**: Checks boundary condition for operand indexing.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Operand out-of-bounds handling errors can cause unintended infinite loops.
