;; 9. **Test Description**:    - Design a loop with a deeply nested `br_table` whose branch targets include indirect jumps within nested structures. The test examines how the engine handles index out-of-bounds scenarios in such deeply nested contexts.    - **Constraint Checked**: Proper handling of indirect jumps within deep nested structures using `br_table` and correct default target handling for out-of-bounds indices.
