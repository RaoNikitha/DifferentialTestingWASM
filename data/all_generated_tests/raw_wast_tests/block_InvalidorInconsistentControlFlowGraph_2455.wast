;; 6. **Test Description**: Establish a block that improperly ends without closing all nested blocks. WebAssembly should flag an improper nesting issue, whereas `wizard_engine` might correctly reset and initialize to handle it.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensuring well-nested blocks.    - **Relation to CFG**: Incomplete CFG paths leading to unreachable code or incorrect end states.
