;; 5. **Test Name: Unwinding Stack Incorrectly on Loop Exit**    **Description:** Instruct the `br_if` to incorrectly unwind the stack when a loop is exited. The `wizard_engine` should explicitly detect this with a stack-related error.    **Infinite Loop Relation:** Incorrect stack unwinding might cause the loop to re-enter erroneously, repeating indefinitely.
