;; 7. **Test 7: Incorrect Type Preservation upon Loop Restart**    - Description: Design a loop where the block type expects a certain type stack before restarting the loop, but a `br` instruction alters the stack in a way that conflicts with this expectation.    - Reasoning: This tests whether the implementation correctly preserves stack types during loop restarts, maintaining expected type invariants.
