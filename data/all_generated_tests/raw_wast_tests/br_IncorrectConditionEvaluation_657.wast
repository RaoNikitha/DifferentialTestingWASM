;; 8. **Failing Condition Based on External Input**:    - Set up a scenario where the condition for a `br_if` is based on external input (e.g., user input causing a value to be pushed onto the stack). If the input does not meet the condition criteria (false), ensure no branch happens, testing if external input is correctly checked.
