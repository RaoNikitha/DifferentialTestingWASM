;; 10. **Test Description**: A loop that uses nested conditions in `br_if`, with a break dependent on both arithmetic and boolean evaluations. Check if the loop logic properly adheres to nested condition results.    - **Constraint**: Ensures `br_if` accurately handles nested arithmetic and boolean condition evaluations.    - **Differential Behavior**: Incorrectly executed loop logic due to improper handling of nested conditions, resulting in false breaks or infinite loops.
