;; 7. **Test Case 7: `nop` inside a nested block structure, ending in `unreachable`:**    - **Constraint Checked:** Validating `nop`â€™s non-interfering nature inside nested blocks.    - **Expected Behavior:** Execution should follow block structure and hit `unreachable`, causing a trap.    - **Differential Behavior:** Wizard_engine might mishandle nested contexts due to improper initialization.
