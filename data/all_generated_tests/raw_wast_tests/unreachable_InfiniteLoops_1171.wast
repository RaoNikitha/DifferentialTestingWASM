;; 2. **Test Description:**    - Place the `unreachable` instruction inside a `loop` immediately before a `br` instruction which should break the loop. The `br` should never execute due to the `unreachable` trap.    - Constraint: Confirms that the unreachable instruction causes an immediate trap, even within loops.    - Infinite Loop Relation: Checks if the loop is bypassed due to the trap, thus testing potential infinite loop prevention.
