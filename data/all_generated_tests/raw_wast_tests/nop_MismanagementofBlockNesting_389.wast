;; 10. **Inline nested block complexity with `nop`:** Create a function with inline nested blocks combined with complex control flow involving jumps (`br`, `br_if`). Ensure that `nop` instructions inside these blocks do not mismanage the stack or control flow, verifying correct block nesting and reset behavior by the `resetSig` method.
