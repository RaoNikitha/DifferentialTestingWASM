;; 10. **Test Description**: Implement a `br_table` instruction targeting both direct and nested `br` labels. Use multiple `nop` instructions around and within target labels and blocks.     - **Constraint Checked**: Verify no impact on complex target resolution with extensive `nop` use.     - **Edge Case Relation**: The combined branching structure should exhibit predictable behavior, unaffected by `nop`, ensuring stack handling remains consistent.
