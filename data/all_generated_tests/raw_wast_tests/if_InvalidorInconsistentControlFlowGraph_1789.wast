;; 10. **Test: Early Exit with Improper Stack Handling**     - **Description**: Include a `br` instruction early in an `if` block that fails to handle the stack correctly, thus causing a mismatch when the `else` block executes.     - **Constraint Checked**: Proper stack handling during early exit and subsequent execution paths.     - **CFG Relevance**: Ensures CFG handles early exits and maintains correct stack states for continuing execution.
