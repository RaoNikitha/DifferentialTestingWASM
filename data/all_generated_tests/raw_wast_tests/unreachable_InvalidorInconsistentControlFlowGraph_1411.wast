;; 2. **Test Description:** Put the `unreachable` instruction inside a loop, followed by loop iterations and a `br` (branch) instruction. This checks whether the loop correctly handles the trap caused by `unreachable` and doesn't continue looping or branch improperly.    - **Constraint:** Immediate trap should break loop execution.    - **Relation to CFG:** Validates CFG's loop termination and branch consistency.
