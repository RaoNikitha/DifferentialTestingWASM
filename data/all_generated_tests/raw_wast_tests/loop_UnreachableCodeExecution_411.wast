;; 2. **Test Description**: A loop block with an inner `block` that conditionally executes an `unreachable` instruction if the loop count exceeds a certain number. Ensure loop unwinding and correct branch evaluation within nested blocks:    - **Constraint Checked**: Correct loop unwinding and inner block branching.    - **Unreachable Code Execution**: Incorrect counting or branch evaluation might lead to reaching `unreachable` prematurely.
