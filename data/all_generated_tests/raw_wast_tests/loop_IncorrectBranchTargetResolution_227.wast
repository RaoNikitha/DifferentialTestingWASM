;; 8. **Test for Correct Operand Stack Unwinding on Branches**:    Feature a loop with stack operations and a `br` that should unwind the stack precisely to the loop's entry point while preserving operand integrity, ensuring branching correctly manages the operand stack. This validates stack unwinding during branching.
