;; 9. **Test Description**: Insert a `br_table` in a loop, with its index dependent on loop counters. Ensure out-of-bounds access is correctly trapped.    - **Specific Constraint**: Loop-driven boundary condition checks for `br_table` indices.    - **Relation to `call`**: Consistency in error handling when `call` indices are influenced by loop counters.
