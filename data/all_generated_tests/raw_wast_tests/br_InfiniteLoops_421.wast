;; 2. **Test Description:**    - Implement a nested loop where the innermost loop uses `br_if` with a condition that should frequently result in the branch being taken. The test should verify correct stack unwinding upon branching.    - **Constraint:** This test validates operand stack management and whether the `br` instruction correctly manipulates the operand stack, preventing infinite loops.
