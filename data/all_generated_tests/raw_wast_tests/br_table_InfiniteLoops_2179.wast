;; 9. **Test 9**: Create a loop that utilizes `br_table` alongside `br_if` and basic arithmetic to adjust the operand dynamically. Test for correct flow control by adjusting the operand to switch labels.    - **Constraint**: Validates combination of `br_table` with other control instructions.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Incorrect operand adjustments can trap the loop.
