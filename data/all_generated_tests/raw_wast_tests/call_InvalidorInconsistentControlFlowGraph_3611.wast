;; 10. **Test Call from an Unreachable Code Section**:     - **Description**: Place a `call x` instruction in a section of code that is statically unreachable.     - **Constraint**: The instruction should never be executed or affect the control flow.     - **Relation to CFG**: An inconsistent CFG might not recognize the unreachable code properly, leading to the call being executed incorrectly.
