;; 3. **Test Description**:    Incorrect Operand Stack in Loop:    - Constraint: Ensure operand stack conformity within `call_indirect` inside a loop.    - Test Behavior: Execute a loop repeatedly calling an indirect function where insufficient operands lead to an error, preventing infinite looping.
