;; 6. **Cross Conditional Loops**: Formulate a function blending nested `if` blocks within `loop` structures, with the `return` lodged within the `else` part of the innermost `if`. The test probes if the `return` respects the accurate control flow, ensuring conditional paths donâ€™t disrupt proper function exit.
