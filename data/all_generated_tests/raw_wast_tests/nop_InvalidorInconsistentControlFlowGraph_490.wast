;; 1. **Test Description**: Create a sequence of nested blocks where each block contains a single `nop` instruction. Verify CFG handles nested blocks correctly.    **Constraint Checked**: Ensures that nesting of blocks doesn't alter flow due to `nop`.    **Relation to CFG**: Verifies the nested structure doesnâ€™t cause unexpected control flow interruptions or unaligned branches.
