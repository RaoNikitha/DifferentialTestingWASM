;; 10. **Loop without Proper Termination**:     - **Description**: Implement a loop where the `end` instruction is either missing or incorrectly placed, disrupting proper loop termination.     - **Constraint Checked**: Well-nested structure and proper termination of loop blocks.     - **CFG Relevance**: Ensures the CFG accurately reflects loop boundaries and detects missing or misplaced termination, preserving control flow integrity.
