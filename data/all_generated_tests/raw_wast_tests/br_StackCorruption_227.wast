;; 8. **Test Invalid Operand Type Handling in Br:**    - **Description:** Execute a `br` instruction with operand types mismatched from the expected stack height in a block.    - **Reasoning:** Ensures correct operand stack balancing when branches are taken.    - **Constraint:** Verify operand type compliance in targets.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption:** Improperly handled operands could lead to unexpected stack heights, corrupting the execution path.
