;; 2. **Test with `br_if` to Conditional Loop Termination**:    - Create a loop with a conditional branch (`br_if`) that exits the loop based on a comparison. Verify stack consistency after loop exit.    - **Constraint**: Proper handling of stack state when a conditional branch is taken.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Incorrect conditional branch handling might leave the stack in an inconsistent state.
