;; 7. **Test Blocks with Incorrectly Managed Operand Stack**:    - Create a block that improperly consumes and produces operands on the stack against its type signature.    - **Reasoning**: Tests if the CFG generation accurately reflects operand stack changes and type mismatches within a block context.    - **Purpose**: Checks for operand stack consistency within the CFG.
