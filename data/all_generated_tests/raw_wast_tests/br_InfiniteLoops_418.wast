;; 9. **Test Description 9:**    - Include a loop with several `br_if` instructions where a complex condition causes a mismatched label look-up, and the loop continues indefinitely rather than breaking.    - **Constraint: Label Lookup Constraint**    - **Relation to Infinite Loop:** Condition miscalculations keep the loop running.
