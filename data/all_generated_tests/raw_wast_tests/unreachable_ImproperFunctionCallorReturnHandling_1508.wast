;; 9. **Test Description:**    - Within an `if` block, an `unreachable` is placed before a `call_indirect`. The result ensures that an improper indirect call and subsequent execution do not occur.    - **Constraint:** Guarantees conditional traps before indirect calls.    - **Improper Function Call or Return Handling:** Validates handling of conditional indirect calls.
