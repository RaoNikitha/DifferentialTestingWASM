;; 9. **Test Description:**    - Integrate `unreachable` at the end of a functionâ€™s body following compounded `if` statements with evaluations that lead to false. The function should exit normally when conditions are false without `unreachable`.    - Constraint: Full function body, conditional verification.    - Relation to Incorrect Condition Evaluation: Ensures ending condition resolutions are correctly handled.
