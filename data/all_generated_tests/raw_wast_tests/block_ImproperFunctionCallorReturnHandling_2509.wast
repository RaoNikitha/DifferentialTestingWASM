;; 10. Test Description: Develop a test where a block has an early return with a subsequent function call inside the block. The return type expected by the block should differ from the functionâ€™s final return type. WebAssembly would catch this through iterative `check_block` operations, while `wizard_engine` might ignore nested return handling, leading to inconsistent executions.
