;; 9. **Test Description**:     Insert `nop` instructions in a function that utilizes indirect calls through a function table. Validate the stack to ensure `nop` doesn't affect indirect call indexes or stack consistency.    **Constraint**: Indirect function calls should work seamlessly with `nop`.    **Reasoning**: Ensures that `nop` does not cause stack corruption affecting indirect calls.
