;; 10. Construct a loop where the condition for `br_if` is based on a function call result. Ensure the called function has an invalid index. WebAssembly should trap and stop infinite looping, but `wizard_engine` might miss this, leading to an infinite loop if it does not properly handle the invalid index.
