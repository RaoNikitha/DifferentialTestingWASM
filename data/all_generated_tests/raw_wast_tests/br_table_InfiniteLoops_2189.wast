;; 9. **Test 9: Repeated Label in `br_table` Vector**    - **Description**: Include repeated labels within the `br_table` vector inside a loop to challenge the handling of non-unique indices and trigger a constant branching condition.    - **Constraint**: Verifies handling of label uniqueness in the vector.    - **Infinite Loop Relation**: Non-unique label handling mistakes can lead to non-terminating behavior in the loop.
