;; 10. Test with a `block` starting with a `br_table` doing a direct branch to the block's own label followed by operations:     - A `block` starts with a `br_table` targeting its own label directly before executing further instructions.     - Specific Constraint: Validates the execution and stack restoration for recursively branching blocks.     - Edge Case: Checks for invalid recursion and re-entry point management within the same block.
