;; 6. **Test 6: Unreachable In Incorrect Operand Type Handling**    - Create a `block` that expects certain operand types which are not on the stack when a `br` instruction is executed. Follow with an `unreachable`.    - Ensures the `br` instructionâ€™s operand type checks prevent unexpected control flow to the unreachable instruction.
