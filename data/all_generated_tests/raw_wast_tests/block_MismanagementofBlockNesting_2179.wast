;; 10. **Test Description**:    Formulate a test with nested blocks where each inner block introduces a branching label through `br_table` that transforms based on stack values, demanding accurate context management. This is to ensure the stack's final state matches the blockâ€™s closing context and correct labels are maintained throughout.
