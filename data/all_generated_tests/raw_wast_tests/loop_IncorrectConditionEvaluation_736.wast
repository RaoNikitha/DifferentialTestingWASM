;; 7. **Test for Loop with Nested Conditional Branches on Varying Conditions**    - **Description**: Create nested conditional branches within a loop, with each employing a `br_if` instruction based on different local variables having distinct values to test branching decisions.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures complex nested conditions do not affect branching decisions.    - **Incorrect Condition Evaluation**: Examines if multiple conditional branches interfere, causing incorrect branches.
