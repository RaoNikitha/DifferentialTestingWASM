;; 8. **Indirect Function Call with Dynamic Type Checking**:    - Test Description: Perform an indirect function call within an `if` instruction with dynamic type checking ensuring the table index correctly resolves.    - Relevant Constraint: Validates dynamic type integrity and indirect call resolution during control flow within `if`.    - Improper Handling Scenario: `wizard_engine` may incorrectly perform type checking or table lookups, leading to erroneous indirect calls.
