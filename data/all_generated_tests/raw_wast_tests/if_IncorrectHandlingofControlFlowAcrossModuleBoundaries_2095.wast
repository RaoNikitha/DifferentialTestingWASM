;; 6. **Test 6: Loop within If-Then Block Calling Imported Function**:    - Description: Include looping constructs within the `then` block of an `if` instruction that call an imported function, validating iterations' impact on stack and control flow.    - Specific Constraint: Loop must maintain stack's state as per `blocktype` between iterations and function calls.    - Relation to Control Flow: Ensures loops within `if` blocks calling across modules manage stacks and labels accurately.
