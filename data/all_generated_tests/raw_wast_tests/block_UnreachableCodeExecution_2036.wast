;; 7. **Sequential Block With Unreachable Disruption**:    - Initiate two blocks in sequence where the first ends in `unreachable` and the second begins validly.    - Handles block labeling and seamless transitions between blocks.    - Mismanagement of end detection executes the second attempted block despite `unreachable`.
