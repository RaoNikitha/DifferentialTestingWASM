;; 6. **Test with a loop containing `nop` and an `if` structure with `br 1`**:    - **Constraint**: Checks if `nop` affects the `if` statement branching logic within loops.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Errors in handling would prevent the branch from breaking out, leading to infinite loops.
