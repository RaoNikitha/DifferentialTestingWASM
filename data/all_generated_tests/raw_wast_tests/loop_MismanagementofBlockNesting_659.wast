;; 10. **Test Description**: Nested `loop` and conditional branches with deliberate misalignment in nesting scope designed to highlight logical branching errors.    - **Constraint Checked**: Highlights correctness in understanding and managing `br_if` and `br` within nested loops.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: Testing improper implementation of control flow logic in structurally complex scenarios leading to mismanaged control flow.
