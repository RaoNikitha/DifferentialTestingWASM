;; 3. **Test 3: Loop with Incorrect Branch Type**    - Define a `loop` that should take `i32` values but includes a `br` instruction attempting to use `i64`.    - Verifies the proper type checking for branches targeting loops.    - Focuses on the forwarding of operand stack types as per loopâ€™s input type requirements.
