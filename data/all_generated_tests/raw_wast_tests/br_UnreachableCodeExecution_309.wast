;; 10. **Test Description:**     - Nested `loop` inside a `block`, where `br` mistakenly targets an outer block instead of the loop, followed by `unreachable`.     - **Constraint: Correct Branch Behavior Between Forward/Backward**     - **Differential Behavior: The Wizard Engine should ensure correct backward jumps to avoid this, while WebAssembly might cause control flow error leading to `unreachable`.**
