;; 2. **Branch to Unopened Label**:    - **Description**: Test `br_if` to a label before any structured control instruction is opened, i.e., trying to branch before any `block`, `loop`, or `if` has been encountered.    - **Constraint**: No labels available for reference.    - **CFG Impact**: CFG may become inconsistent as it includes a branch to a non-existent control structure.
