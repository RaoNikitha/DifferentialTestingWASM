;; 3. **Test Name: Dynamic Condition Infinite Loop**    - **Description**: Implement a loop where the body modifies a local variable, but the condition for `br_if` always ensures the loop re-evaluation.    - **Constraint Checked**: Correct computation and checking of dynamic conditions within the loop.    - **Infinite Loop Relation**: Despite variable changes, the condition always causes the branch to loop back.
