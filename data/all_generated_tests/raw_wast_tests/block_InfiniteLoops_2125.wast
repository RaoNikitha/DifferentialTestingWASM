;; 6. **Invalid `block` Nesting**:    - **Test Description**: Have a `block` that contains improperly nested loops leading to an endless execution path because the blocks are not correctly closed.    - **Constraint**: Ensuring correct nesting of blocks so that control flow can properly escape loops.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Incorrectly nested blocks can prevent proper loop termination.
