;; 1. **Test 1: Unreachable Before Function Call**    - Description: Insert an `unreachable` instruction just before a direct function call. The test checks if the function call is never executed due to the unconditional trap.      - *Constraint:* Ensures that the control flow is correctly interrupted by `unreachable` before reaching the function call.      - *Improper Handling Check:* Verifies that `unreachable` invalidates the call to the function.
