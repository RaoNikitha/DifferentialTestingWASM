;; 7. **Infinite Loop Check with Nop and Control Structure Mixing**:    - Mix `nop` instructions with various control structures like `block`, `loop`, and `if` within a single loop. The test will check the `resetSig` methodâ€™s ability to maintain correct control flow and context.    - Constraint: Control structures should behave as intended without entering an infinite loop because of `nop`.
