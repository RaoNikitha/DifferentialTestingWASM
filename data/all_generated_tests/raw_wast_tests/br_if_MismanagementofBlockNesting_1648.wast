;; 9. **Test 9: Complex Nesting with br_if Near Boundary**    - **Description:** A complex nesting of loops and blocks with a `br_if` near the boundary of the outer control structure.    - **Constraint Checked:** Ensuring boundary conditions within control structures are handled correctly.    - **Mismanagement Relation:** Verifying correct stack unwinding and label targeting near the transition between nested structures.
