;; 3. **Test Description:** Create a WASM module with a function that possesses a loop with multiple nested blocks. Use `br` to branch out of a block and continue execution with a call to another module's function right from within the loop.    **Specific Constraint:** This test evaluates if backward jumps to loops are handled correctly with operands correctly managed.    **Relation to Control Flow Boundaries:** Ensures that intra-loop control flow and subsequent module call do not corrupt the stack or labels.
