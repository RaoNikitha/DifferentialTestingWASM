;; 7. **Test Description**:     Create a module with a loop containing a `block` instruction. Inside the block, place a `call_indirect` instruction followed by a nested loop that contains another `call_indirect`. Insert `br_table` at various depths of the nested structures.    **Constraint**: Verify that control flow between the nested loops and block is accurately maintained and that both `call_indirect` calls handle their type checks without causing traps.    **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: This test ensures that nested loops and blocks correctly manage control flow and function calls, avoiding incorrect exits or traps due to type mismatches.
