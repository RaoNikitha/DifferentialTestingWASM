;; 5. **Infinite Loop Triggered by Incorrect Type Checking**:    - **Description**: Construct a program where a loop contains calls with mismatched argument types that are checked incorrectly leading to an attempt to re-evaluate the loop condition.    - **Reason**: This tests the type-checking mechanism's correctness in loops. Mismanagement can trigger re-evaluations, effectively creating an infinite loop.
