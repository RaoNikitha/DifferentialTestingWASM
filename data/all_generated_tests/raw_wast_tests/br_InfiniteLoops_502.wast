;; 3. **Test Description:**    - Generate a loop where a `br` instruction targets a label defined in an outer scope. Make sure there is a missing operand when the `br` instruction is called.    - **Constraint Checking:** Tests whether the `br` implementation correctly identifies missing operands and handles the control flow accordingly.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops:** Failure in identifying missing operands may leave the loop in an infinite state due to unresolved control flow.
