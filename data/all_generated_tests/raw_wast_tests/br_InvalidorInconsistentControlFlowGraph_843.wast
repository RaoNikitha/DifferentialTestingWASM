;; 4. **Mismatched Operand Types in Backward Branches:**    - **Test Description:** Create a loop that expects specific operand types and use a `br` instruction to jump back to the loop. Ensure that consumed operands differ in type from the loopâ€™s input types to test type conformance.    - **Constraint Tested:** Operand type matching for loops.    - **CFG Relevance:** Incorrect operand types can distort the CFG, leading to misalignment between expected and actual flow states within loops.
