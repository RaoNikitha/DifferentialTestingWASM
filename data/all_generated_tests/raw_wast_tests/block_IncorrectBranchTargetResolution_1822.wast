;; 3. **Test Description**: Construct a block with an incorrect branch target resolved due to improper handling of sibling block labels in wizard_engine.    - **Constraint**: Confirm that branches are mapped to the appropriate target block, not its siblings.    - **Relation**: This checks the block's implicit labels are appropriately scoped within their nesting.
