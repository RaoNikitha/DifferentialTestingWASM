;; 5. **Test Description:**    Create a test where `br_if` checks a condition immediately after a stack manipulation (e.g., `i32.add`). The condition should only be `true` if the result of the addition is zero.    - **Constraint Checked:** Proper condition evaluation following arithmetic operations.    - **Relation to Incorrect Condition Evaluation:** Ensures conditions dependent on operand stack operations are not mishandled.
