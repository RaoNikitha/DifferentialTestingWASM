;; 4. **Test 4**: Design a module where a function includes a `br_table` with a label that is out of range. Call this function and observe if the WebAssembly architecture properly traps indicating an invalid index, and whether the Wizard_engine reacts differently by not recognizing the out-of-bounds access.
