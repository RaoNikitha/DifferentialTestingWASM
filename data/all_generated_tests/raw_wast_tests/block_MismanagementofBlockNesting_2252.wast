;; 3. **Test Description**: Implement a nested block structure where nested `if` conditions branch (via `br_if`) to different block levels, with an edge case where the inner `if`'s branch condition is always false.    - **Constraint**: Ensure that `br_if` properly integrates with varying nesting depths and false branch conditions.    - **Nesting Mismanagement Check**: Confirms that nested branches with false conditions are managed accurately.
