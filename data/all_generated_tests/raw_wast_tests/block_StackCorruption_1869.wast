;; 10. **Test Description**:    Develop a block scenario where exception handling (if supported) interacts with stack states. Within the block, simulate a sequence of stack operations interrupted by an exception throw and catch sequence. Verify whether the unwinding of the stack during exceptions maintains a coherent stack state post-exception handling.  These test descriptions ensure various edge cases and bigger scenarios where stack management by different WebAssembly implementations in `block` instructions can lead to stack corruption if not handled correctly. These tests specifically target the nuanced differences in stack state handling between the specified environments.
