;; 9. **Test 9: Complex Loop with Breaks and Unreachable Leading to Type Confusion**    - A complex `loop` construction using `br` instructions where an `unreachable` instruction leads to mismatching types upon breaking the loop.    - **Constraint Checked:** Evaluates if loop breaks correctly handle the type derivation involving an `unreachable` instruction.
