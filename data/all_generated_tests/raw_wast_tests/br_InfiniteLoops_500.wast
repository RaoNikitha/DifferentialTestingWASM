;; 1. **Test Description:**    - Create a test with a deeply nested loop structure where the innermost loop contains a `br` instruction. Ensure that the target label of the `br` instruction does not match the expected type on the operand stack.    - **Constraint Checking:** This tests whether the implementation correctly handles operand types when unwinding the stack for the `br` instruction.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops:** Incorrect type checking may result in an unexpected operand stack state, causing the loop to behave unpredictably.
