;; 10. **Combining Multiple Control Structures with `nop`**:     - Create a test involving a combination of blocks, loops, conditionals, and switch tables, all containing `nop` at various points. Verify overall control flow and execution.    - This comprehensive test checks for any potential mismanagement due to `nop` in a complex scenario blending multiple control structures.
