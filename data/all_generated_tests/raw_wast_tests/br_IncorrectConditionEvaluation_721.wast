;; 2. **Test Description:**    Check a `br_if` instruction within a `loop` that should only execute the branch when a counter variable is even. Introduce a condition always evaluating to `true` erroneously.    - **Constraint Checked:** Accurate branching within a loop based on a dynamically changing condition.    - **Relation to Incorrect Condition Evaluation:** Tests prevention of unconditional branching regardless of loop condition.
