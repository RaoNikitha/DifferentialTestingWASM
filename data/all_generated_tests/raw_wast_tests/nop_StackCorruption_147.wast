;; 8. **Test Description**:    Use `nop` interspersed within a series of push and pop operations on the operand stack. Ensure the sequence of expected values is maintained throughout.    **Constraint Checked**: Validates `nop` does not disrupt the sequence of stack operations.    **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Errors might lead to operand stack corruption, with values being incorrectly handled.
