;; 10. **Uninitialized Label Access**:     - **Description**: Create a scenario where `br_if` attempts to reference a label in a context where no labels have been initialized.     - **Constraint**: Initialization and label setup.     - **CFG Impact**: Branch to an uninitialized label breaks the CFG assumptions, leading to broken control paths.
