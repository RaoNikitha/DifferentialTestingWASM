;; 9. **Test 9: Branch Instructions with Type Mismatches**    - Instructions where `br` attempts to branch with incorrect types of operands or mismatches between branch arguments and destination block types.    - Constraint: Validate proper type enforcement and avoidance of stack corruption due to type mismatches.    - Stack Corruption Check: Ensure stack remains consistent even when type errors occur in branch instructions.
