;; 8. **Test Description**:    Construct a `block` where `blocktype` specifies `i64`, but include a `loop` within the block that only maintains `i32` types and check the outer blockâ€™s type handling when the loop exits.    **Constraint**: Inner control structures must ultimately conform to outer block types.    **Relation**: Validates complex control flow type consistency.
