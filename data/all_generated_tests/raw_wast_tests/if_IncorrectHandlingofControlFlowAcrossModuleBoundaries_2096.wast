;; 7. **Test 7: Loop within If-Else Block with External Calls**:    - Description: Include looping constructs within the `else` block of an `if` instruction that call an imported function, with a focus on stack and control management.    - Specific Constraint: Validate consistency and blocktype specifications in the stack during loop iterations and external calls.    - Relation to Control Flow: Tests loops within `else` blocks for proper stack and control handling across module boundaries.
