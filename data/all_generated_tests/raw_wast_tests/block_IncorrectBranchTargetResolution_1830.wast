;; 1. **Test Unwinding Operand Stack for `br` Instruction**:    - Create a `block` with `i32` type that has a `br` instruction targeting an outer block. Ensure the inner block consumes an additional operand that is not present in the outer block's context.    - This test checks if the correct block level is targeted, verifying the stack is unwound and operands are set correctly according to the block type.
