;; 8. **Test: Invalid Stack State at `end`**    - **Description**: Design an `if` structure where the stack state is incorrect at the `end` instruction due to previous stack manipulations.    - **Constraint Checked**: Final stack state consistency at the end of an `if` block.    - **CFG Relevance**: Validates that the CFG correctly tracks stack states up to block termination.
