;; 4. **Test 4: Recursively Called Function with Loop and Incorrect Return Handling**    - **Constraint:** Proper handling of recursive function calls within loops.    - **Description:** Test a scenario where a function within the loop calls itself recursively. If the return from recursion does not correctly exit the loop, it should lead to an infinite loop.
