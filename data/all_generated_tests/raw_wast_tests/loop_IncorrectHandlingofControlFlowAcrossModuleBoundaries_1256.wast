;; 7. **Unconditional Branch Inside Exported Function in Loop**:    - Test a loop executing an unconditional branch (`br`) that targets an exported function. Verify that the function correctly handles the branch and returns control to the correct point in the loop.    - **Constraint**: Ensures correct branch target handling and execution flow continuity across module boundaries.
