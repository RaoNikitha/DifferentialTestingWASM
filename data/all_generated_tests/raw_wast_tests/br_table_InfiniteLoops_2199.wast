;; 9. **Test 9: `br_table` with Mixed Forward and Backward Labels**    - Description: Include a mix of forward and backward labels in a `br_table` vector within a loop to observe branching behavior.    - Specific Constraint: Ensure mixed label handling is correctly performed within the structured control flow.    - Infinite Loop Relation: Incorrect handling of mixed labels might lead to unexpected loop re-entries causing infinite iterations.
