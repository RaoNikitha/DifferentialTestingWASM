;; 9. **Test 9: `nop` Before `br_table` With Maximum Integer Index**    - Assess the behavior of a `br_table` instruction with a maximum integer index following a `nop` instruction to test potential overflow or improper handling.    - Constraint: Confirm that the `nop` does not influence the handling of extreme index values and that correct traps are triggered.
