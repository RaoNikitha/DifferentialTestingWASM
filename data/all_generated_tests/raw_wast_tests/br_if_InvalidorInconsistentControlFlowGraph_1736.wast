;; 7. **Test 7**:    - **Description**: Loop structure with `br_if` instruction checking for a condition and possibly jumping to an earlier loop construct, along with operand verification.    - **Constraint**: Verifying backward jump and operand consistency in loops.    - **CFG Relation**: Tests for correct backward branch CFG integration with loops.
