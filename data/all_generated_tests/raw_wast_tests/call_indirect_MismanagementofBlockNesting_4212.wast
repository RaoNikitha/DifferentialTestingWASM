;; 1. **Test Description**:     Create a WebAssembly module with a nested block structure where a `call_indirect` instruction attempts to call a function. Place the `call_indirect` within the inner block and execute a `br` instruction to exit the outer block conditionally based on a function result.    **Constraint**: Verify that the correct block is exited and that the function type checking within the nested blocks is correctly handled, ensuring no traps are triggered due to type mismatches.    **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: This test checks that the nested block structure is correctly managed, and the proper block is exited when conditions are met.
