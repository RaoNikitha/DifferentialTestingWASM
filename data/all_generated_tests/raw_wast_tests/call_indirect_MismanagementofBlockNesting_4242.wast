;; 1. **Test Description:**    Test a `call_indirect` within deeply nested blocks (`block`) and loops (`loop`) to verify if the nested structure is correctly managed without prematurely exiting. The test should ensure that correct flow control is maintained across multiple nested levels.    - **Constraint Checked:** Correct nesting of control structures with `call_indirect`.    - **Mismanagement Relation:** Validates the correct handling of nested blocks without erroneous exits.
