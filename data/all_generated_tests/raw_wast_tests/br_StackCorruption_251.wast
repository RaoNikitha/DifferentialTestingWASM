;; 2. **Test 2: Loop Resumption with Operand Consumption**    - A loop containing a `br` instruction that jumps back to the beginning of the loop with multiple operands being consumed and then replaced on the stack.    - Constraint: Verify correct handling of operand stack unwinding and re-placing operands when branching to the start of a loop.    - Stack Corruption Check: Ensure stack content is correctly maintained when performing backward branches.
