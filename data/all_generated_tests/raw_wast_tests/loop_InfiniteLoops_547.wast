;; 8. **Test Description**: Compose a loop that constantly reinitializes due to incorrect `br` behavior, with a separate independent condition inside to verify if the loop is ever exited.    **Constraint Checked**: Check reinitialization of loop execution and branch instruction behavior.    **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Demonstrates if incorrect reinitialization can cause infinite loops, and if independent conditions are disregarded.
