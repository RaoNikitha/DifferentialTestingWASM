;; 5. **Test with Forward and Backward Branching:**     - Description: Create a `br_table` instruction that branches both forward and backward, ensuring both types of branches handle the operand stack according to the block's type.    - Constraint Checked: Handling of forward and backward branches with respect to operand stack types.    - Relates to Unreachable Code Execution: Incorrect type matching or stack handling can cause misconfiguration leading to the execution of the `unreachable` instruction.
