;; 8. **Test Description**: Embed a `loop` inside a `block` followed by another `loop` outside the `block`. Place a `br_if` targeting the outer loop from inside the inner loop. Verify the control flow respects this complex nesting and correctly targets the outer loop.    - **Constraint Checked**: Correct resolution of nested loop and block boundaries.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: Conflicts in layer handling might cause unintended exits or loop continuing incorrectly.
