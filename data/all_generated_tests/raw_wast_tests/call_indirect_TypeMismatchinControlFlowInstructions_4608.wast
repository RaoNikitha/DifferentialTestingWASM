;; 7. **Test Description**:    - Create a test to perform a `call_indirect` within a try-catch block where the expected function type expects a string (unsupported in WASM), and the actual function provides an integer, expecting a strict adherence to types leading to a trap.    - **Constraint Being Checked**:      - Proper enforcement of recognized and supported type constraints within control flow handlers.    - **Relation to Control Flow Instructions**:      - Ensures error handling mechanisms enforce WASM type norms.
