;; 8. **Test Description**:    Out-of-Bounds Function Reference Within Loop:    - Constraint: Check out-of-bounds function reference handling by `call_indirect` in a loop.    - Test Behavior: Execute a loop where `call_indirect` references a function beyond the bounds of the designated table, resulting in a trap.
