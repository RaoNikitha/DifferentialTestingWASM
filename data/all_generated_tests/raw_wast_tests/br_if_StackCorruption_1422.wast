;; 3. **Test Description**:     Test a `loop` with a `br_if` instruction branching back to the start of the loop if a condition is met. Use the operand stack to validate proper unwinding and check that the loop executes without errors.    - **Constraint Checked**: Correct handling of backward branching.    - **Stack Corruption Check**: Checks for proper restoration and stacking of operands on each iteration.
