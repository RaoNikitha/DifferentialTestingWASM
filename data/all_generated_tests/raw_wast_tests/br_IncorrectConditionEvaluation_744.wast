;; 5. **Test Description**: Use a `br_if` instruction with a dynamic condition that evaluates to true.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures that the `br_if` evaluates conditions dynamically during runtime.    - **Incorrect Condition Evaluation**: The branching might be incorrect if conditional evaluations are improperly handled.
