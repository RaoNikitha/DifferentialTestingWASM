;; 9. **Test Description**:     - Set up a loop with nested conditional blocks where a `br_if` with a false condition should correctly continue the loop.    - **Constraint Checking**: Ensures conditional blocks within loops are properly evaluated and continued depending on conditions.    - **Infinite Loop Relation**: Validates that the false condition doesn't exit prematurely, causing infinite continuation due to mismanaged stack transitions or labels.
