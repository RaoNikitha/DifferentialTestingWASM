;; 3. **Test Description**: Implement a scenario where a series of nested blocks perform `br_if` instructions such that one conditional branch drains all the operands, leaving insufficient operands for the next conditional branch.   - **Constraint Being Checked**: Enforcement of stack requirements after conditions in a sequence of conditionals.   - **Stack Corruption Aspect**: Conditional branching improperly handled would corrupt the stack, leaving it shorter than expected for the next operation.
