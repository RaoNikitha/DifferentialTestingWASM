;; 5. **Test Description:**    - Construct a loop with a `br_if` that conditionally branches out based on a stack value. Introduce a mismatch in the type of the stack value before the condition check.    - **Constraint Checking:** Checks if the implementation accurately verifies the stack value's type before executing the conditional branch.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops:** An incorrect type check may prevent the branch from executing, leading to an infinite loop.
