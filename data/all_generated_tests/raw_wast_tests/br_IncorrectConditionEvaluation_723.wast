;; 4. **Test Description:**    Design a deeply nested control structure (`block` > `if` > `loop`) with a `br_if` that uses a condition based on multiple arithmetic expressions. Validate each step ensures correct condition handling.    - **Constraint Checked:** Correct condition evaluation in deeply nested control structures.    - **Relation to Incorrect Condition Evaluation:** Ensures complex conditions are evaluated correctly to avoid erroneous branching.
