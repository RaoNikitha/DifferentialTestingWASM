;; 7. **Test Description**: Design a scenario where a `br_if` in a `block` targets a `loop` that is nested further inside another `block`. Validate backward jump resolution.    - **Constraint Checked**: Resolution of nested branching when not directly enclosed.    - **Related Issue**: Properly identifying jumping paths and indices in complex nestings.
