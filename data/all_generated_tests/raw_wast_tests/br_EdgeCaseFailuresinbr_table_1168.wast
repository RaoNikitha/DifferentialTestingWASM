;; 9. **Test with Dynamic Index Boundaries:**    - Implement a `br_table` with dynamically calculated indices that can swing between valid and invalid due to runtime conditions.      - **Constraint Checked:** Checks real-time index boundary validation under variable conditions.      - **Edge Case Insight:** Ensures dynamic scenarios donâ€™t lead to index errors from real-time value changes.
