;; 5. Write a WebAssembly function with an `if` block containing a `loop`, and place another `if` block inside this loopâ€™s `else` branch. Test the behavior with a `br` instruction targeting the outermost block. This checks whether the reset mechanism accurately maintains control flow across nested if-else-loops.
