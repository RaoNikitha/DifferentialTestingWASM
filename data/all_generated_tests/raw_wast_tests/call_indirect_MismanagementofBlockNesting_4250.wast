;; 9. **Test Description:**    Employ `call_indirect` within a block structure that includes mixed `br` and `br_table` instructions to ensure that jumping across multiple nested layers correctly maintains operand stack integrity and control flow.    - **Constraint Checked:** Mixed branching management within nested blocks.    - **Mismanagement Relation:** Confirms that mixed branching does not disrupt nested block management, leading to unintended behavior.
