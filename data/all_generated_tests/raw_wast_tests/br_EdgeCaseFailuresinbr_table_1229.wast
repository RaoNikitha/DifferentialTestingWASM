;; 10. **Uninitialized Indices:**     - Description: Implement a `br_table` where some indices are uninitialized or set to an invalid number.     - Spot how the implementation interprets and handles uninitialized indices, ensuring no undefined behavior.     - Specific Constraint: Ensure the implementation does not crash and handles invalid or uninitialized indices gracefully.
