;; 10. **Test Description**: A `block` instruction immediately after a function call within another `block`, where the functionâ€™s incorrect return triggers an `unreachable` scenario inside the second `block`. This tests function call integration within `block` instructions, examining stack unwinding and type conformance in the presence of an error.
