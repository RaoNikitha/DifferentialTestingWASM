;; 9. **Test Description**:    - **Constraint Checked**: Handling zero and non-zero conditions of `br_if`.    - **Details**: Implement a series of `br_table` tests where `br_if` conditions fluctuate between zero and non-zero, validating if branches are correctly taken.    - **Relation to Edge Case**: Ensures accurate conditional branching based on stack value, maintaining correctness in branch decision-making.
