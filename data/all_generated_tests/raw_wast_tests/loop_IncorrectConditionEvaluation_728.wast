;; 9. **Test Description**: A loop utilizing a `br_if` whose condition is a comparison of stack-popped values. Verify the correct behavior based on varied stack inputs.    - **Constraint**: Tests if `br_if` correctly evaluates conditions involving stack-popped value comparisons.    - **Differential Behavior**: Loop continues or exits erroneously based on stack value comparisons due to condition evaluation issues.
