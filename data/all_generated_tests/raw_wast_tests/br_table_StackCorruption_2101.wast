;; Here's a list of 10 unique differential tests focusing on potential stack corruption in the implementations of `br_table` for WebAssembly and wizard_engine:  1. **Mismatched Arity in Nested Blocks:**    - Test a `br_table` instruction within nested `block` structures with mismatched operand types in various label targets to see if the stack is improperly unwound or corrupted.
