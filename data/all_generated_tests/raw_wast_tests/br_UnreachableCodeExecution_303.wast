;; 4. **Test Description:**    - Introduce a block within a function with an `if` condition that will always lead to a `br` instruction targeting an invalid label, subsequently hitting `unreachable`.    - **Constraint: Target Label Validity**    - **Differential Behavior: The Wizard Engine should recognize the invalid jump and throw an error, whereas WebAssembly might erroneously encounter `unreachable`.**
