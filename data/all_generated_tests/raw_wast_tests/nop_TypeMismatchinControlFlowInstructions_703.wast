;; 4. **Test for Incorrect Type Assumptions in `br` after `nop`**:    - **Description**: Write a function that uses `nop` before a `br` (branch) instruction and checks for operand types consistency required by the branch.    - **Constraint Checked**: Verifies the consistency of stack types during branching control flow.    - **Relation**: Ensures that the stack remains in a valid state even after inserting `nop` before a branch, checking for type mismatches caused by node initialization issues.
