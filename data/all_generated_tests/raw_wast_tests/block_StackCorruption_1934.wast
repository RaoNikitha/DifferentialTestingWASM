;; 5. **Test Description**: Design a `block` that uses the `br_if` instruction with a condition that is not properly consuming the correct number of operands from the stack.    - **Constraint Checked**: Checks for proper stack manipulation and operand consumption by conditional branch instructions within a block.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Mismanagement of conditional branches can alter expected stack contents, leading to stack inconsistencies and corruption.
