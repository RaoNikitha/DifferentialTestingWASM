;; 9. **Test 9: Loop with Inter-dependent Operand Checks**    - A loop within a block that continuously branches (`br_if`) based on inter-dependent stack operand checks, maintaining a complex condition matrix.    - Tests if operands are correctly evaluated in relation to each other to ensure loop is not stuck in infinite condition.
