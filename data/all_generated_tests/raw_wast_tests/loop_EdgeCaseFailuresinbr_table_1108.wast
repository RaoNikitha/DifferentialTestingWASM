;; 9. **Test Nine**:    - A loop block containing `br_table` instructions with indirect indices obtained from operations (like division by zero).    - **Constraint**: Ensures indirect indices from exceptional operations do not breach the intended loop block boundaries.    - **Relation**: Checks edge cases from arithmetic operations affecting table indices.
