;; 8. **Test: Forward Branch with Incompatible Block Types**    - **Description**:      A `br_table` instruction forward branching into a block that expects an `i64` type but receiving an `f32` operand.    - **Constraint Checked**:      Checks proper type enforcement during forward branch operations.    - **Related Type Mismatch**:      Incompatible types during forward branching.
