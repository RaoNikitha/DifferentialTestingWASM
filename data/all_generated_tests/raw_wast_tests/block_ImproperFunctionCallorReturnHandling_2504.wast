;; 5. Test Description: Create a block that calls a function conditionally using `br_if` followed by a `return` within the block. The function type should slightly differ from the blockâ€™s expected type. WebAssembly should detect the mismatch immediately, while `wizard_engine` might mishandle the conditional call and stack.
