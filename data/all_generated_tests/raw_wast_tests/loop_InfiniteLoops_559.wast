;; - **Test 10**:    Set up a loop containing floating-point operations that depend on an approximation leading to non-breaking condition (e.g., looping while a number is not zero, but the approximation never exactly hits zero).     Constraint: Floating-point approximation causing infinite loop.     Relation: Shows impact of precision error leading to infinite loop.
