;; 9. **Test: Invalid Forward Branch with Polymorphic Stack**:    - **Description**: Implement a forward branch using `br_if` with a polymorphically modified stack containing insufficient matching operands for the block's signature.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures the operand stack meets the required forward branch signature of the target block.    - **Relation to Incorrect Branch Target Resolution**: Prevents mismatches in operand type and count from causing incorrect forward branch resolution, ensuring control flow integrity.
