;; 5. **Test Description**:     - Utilize a `br_if` within a loop that pushes multiple operands and then evaluates a condition much later, ensuring it processes according to label results.    - **Constraint Checking**: Verifies sequence preservation and correct stack management over complex operand manipulations.    - **Infinite Loop Relation**: Ensures that complex operands do not lead to infinite looping due to mismanagement in `wizard_engine`'s label argument differentiation.
