;; 9. **Test Description 9**:    - **Test**: Loop with multiple `br_if` instructions executed sequentially, each depending on different logical evaluations.    - **Constraint**: Confirm that each `br_if` evaluates conditions independently and accurately.    - **Reason**: Complex, multi-branch scenarios may reveal implementation flaws.
