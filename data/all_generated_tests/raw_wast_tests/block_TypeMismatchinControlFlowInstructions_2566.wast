;; 7. **Test Description**:    Create a scenario where a `br` or `br_if` targets a block with a mismatch in the value type on the operand stack, ensuring that this inconsistency triggers a type-checking failure.    **Constraint:** Validating operand stack unwinding and re-stacking with branching.    **Relation to Type Mismatch:** Tests type consistency when branching within blocks.
