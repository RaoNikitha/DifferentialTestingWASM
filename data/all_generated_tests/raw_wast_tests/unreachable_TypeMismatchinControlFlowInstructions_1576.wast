;; 7. **Test Description:** Formulate a test with an `unreachable` inside a `block` with an explicit return type, surrounded by stack-manipulative instructions like multiple `drop` that depend on the blockâ€™s stack consistency.    **Constraint:** The stack typing needs to be verified even with multiple instructions that affect stack depth/type.    **Reasoning:** Assures that complex stack operations around `unreachable` maintain type consistency.
