;; 2. Insert `unreachable` within a conditional block (`if` block) and verify if the blockâ€™s alternate branch executes without issues. Ensure that control flow outside the `if` structure remains unaffected.    - **Constraint:** Confirm that the `unreachable` instruction correctly interrupts the active block without affecting other branches.    - **CFG Check:** Ensure that conditional branches are properly managed in the presence of `unreachable`.
