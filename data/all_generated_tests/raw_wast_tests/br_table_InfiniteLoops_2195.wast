;; 5. **Test 5: Loop with Conditional `br_table` Branching**    - Description: Implement a loop that conditionally branches using `br_table` instructions to different labels, some leading back to the loop start.    - Specific Constraint: Tests whether conditional branching within a loop is correctly managed to avoid infinite loops.    - Infinite Loop Relation: Mismanaged conditions can fail to exit the loop, resulting in an infinite loop.
