;; 6. **Test for Conditional Branch to Re-evaluated Loop Start**    - **Description**: Construct a loop with a `br_if` instruction evaluating a condition based on re-evaluated local variables mid-execution, ensuring it branches back to the start as expected.    - **Constraint Checked**: Checks re-evaluation logic of conditions in the loop.    - **Incorrect Condition Evaluation**: Validates whether the loop re-entry condition is evaluated and followed correctly.
