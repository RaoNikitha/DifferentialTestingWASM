;; 4. **Test Block with Forward `br` Misreference**:    - Implement a block with a forward `br` that wrongly targets an instruction beyond the block’s ending.    - This evaluates the block’s control flow without surpassing its boundary.    - Expected result: WebAssembly should fail due to incorrect forward referencing, but wizard_engine might not detect the error.
