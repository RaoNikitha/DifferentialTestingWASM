;; 1. **Test: BrTable with Single Target Label, Type Mismatch**    - **Description**:      A `br_table` instruction with a single target label that expects an `i32` argument but is given an `i64` during execution.    - **Constraint Checked**:      Ensures that the `br_table` correctly identifies type mismatches between the operand stack and the expected label type.    - **Related Type Mismatch**:      Forward branch assuming incorrect type for operand.
