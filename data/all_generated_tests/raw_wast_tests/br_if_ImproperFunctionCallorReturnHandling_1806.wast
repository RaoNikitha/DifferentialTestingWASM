;; 7. **Test: Indirect Function Call with Conditional Operand Removal**    - **Description:** Implement an indirect function call within a loop, with a `br_if` that conditionally removes operands required by the function based on the stack's state.    - **Constraint Check:** Checks the consistency of operand stack handling during indirect calls and ensures the function retrieves proper arguments even with branching.
