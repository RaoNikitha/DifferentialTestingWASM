;; 2. **Nested Loop with `br_if` Mislabeling**:    - **Description**: Test a conditional branch (`br_if`) within a nested loop setup where `br_if` is supposed to target the innermost loop, but mislabeling causes it to incorrectly target an outer block.    - **Constraint**: Validity of label indexing in `br_if` to ensure it correctly targets the correct loop based on the given condition.
