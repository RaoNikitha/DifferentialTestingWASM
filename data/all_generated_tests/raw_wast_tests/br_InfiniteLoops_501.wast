;; 2. **Test Description:**    - Design a loop with a conditional branch (`br_if`) that should break out of the loop. Introduce a type mismatch in the loop to see if the `br` instruction handles it correctly.    - **Constraint Checking:** Validates that the `br` instruction checks the operand stack correctly against the target label's expected types.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops:** If the branch does not execute due to type mismatches, the loop may run indefinitely.
