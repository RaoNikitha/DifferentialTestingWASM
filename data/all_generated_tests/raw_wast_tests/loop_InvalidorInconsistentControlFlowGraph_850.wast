;; 1. **Unreachable Code Beyond Loop**:    - **Description**: Create a test where a `loop` instruction is followed by additional unreachable instructions. Ensure that a `br` instruction within the loop correctly targets the end of the loop, making the subsequent instructions unreachable.     - **Constraint Checked**: Correct handling of the implicit label and proper termination of the loop to avoid invalid CFG where the extra instructions should not be executed.    - **CFG Relevance**: Confirms that unreachable sections are correctly identified and starts a new path in the CFG beyond the loop block.
