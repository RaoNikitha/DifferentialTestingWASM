;; 7. **Test Description:**    - Utilize `loop` with proper block alignment, but with a `br` instruction depth improperly calculated due to missing entry operand, leading to `unreachable`.    - **Constraint: Operand Stack Unwinding**    - **Differential Behavior: The Wizard Engine should check and correct the depth, but WebAssembly might cause `unreachable` execution from stack mismanagement.**
