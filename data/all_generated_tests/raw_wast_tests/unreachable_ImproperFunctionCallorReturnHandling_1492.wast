;; 3. **Unreachable after Call and Return:**    - **Test Description:** Implement a function that calls another function which returns successfully, followed immediately by an `unreachable` instruction.    - **Constraint Checked:** This verifies that the call returns correctly before the `unreachable` triggers a trap.    - **Improper Handling Aspect:** Confirms that return value processing is completed before the trap interrupts further execution.
