;; 4. **Branch Out of Block and Imported Function Return**:    - Construct a scenario with an exported function that branches out of a `block` and then calls an imported function. This test will ensure that control flow is handled correctly, and the operand stack is managed accurately throughout the execution flow across module boundaries.
