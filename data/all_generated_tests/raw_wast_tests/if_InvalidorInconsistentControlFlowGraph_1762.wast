;; 3. **Inconsistent Operand Stack Usage between Branches**:    - Create an `if` instruction where the operand stack's height is modified inconsistently between the `then` and `else` blocks, leading to stack misalignment.    - *Constraint*: Stack management rules require the operand stack to be consistent across branches.    - *Relation to CFG*: Tests CFGâ€™s management of operand stacks across conditional branches.
