;; 1. **Test Description:**    A function containing a deeply nested block structure with multiple `unreachable` instructions at different levels, followed by `br_table` that references varying depths.    - **Constraint Checked:** Ensures that the `unreachable` instruction within nested blocks correctly traps without allowing the `br_table` to manipulate the control flow improperly.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting:** Verifies if the depth of the nested blocks is correctly interpreted and handled during a trap caused by `unreachable`.
