;; 9. **Test Premature Loop Exit with Incomplete Stack Maintenance**:    - Implement a loop that exits prematurely with a branch instruction without fully processing the intended stack operations. Validate the resultant stack state.    - **Constraint**: Proper balance between loop logic and stack maintenance despite premature exit conditions.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Incomplete stack operations before loop exit can result in underflow or corrupted stack data.
