;; 5. **Test Description**: Include a forward branch within a block that conditionally targets the end of the block depending on a dynamic runtime condition. Implementing it incorrectly initially could cause WebAssembly to skip essential instructions, unlike `wizard_engine`.    - **Constraint Checked**: Accurate forward branch operations.    - **Relation to CFG**: Incorrect forward branching disrupting the CFG by skipping intended execution paths.
