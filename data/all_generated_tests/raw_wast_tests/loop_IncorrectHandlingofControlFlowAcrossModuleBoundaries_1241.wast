;; 2. **Test: Loop with Conditional Branch to Exported Function**    Description: Construct a loop wherein a `br_if` conditionally branches to a function exported from another module. Ensure that control flow to the exported function is correctly managed and execution resumes within the loop afterward.    Constraints:     - Verify that the context and operand stack are maintained.    - Ensure the imported function correctly handles results.    - Validate the consistency of branch conditions across module boundaries.
