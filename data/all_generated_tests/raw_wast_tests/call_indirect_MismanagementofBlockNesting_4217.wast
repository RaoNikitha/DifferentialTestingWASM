;; 6. **Test Description**:     Design a complex nested structure with alternating `loop` and `block` instructions. Inside, include `call_indirect` instructions and use the `br_if` instruction within loops to conditionally exit based on the `call_indirect` call results.    **Constraint**: Ensure that the loops and blocks maintain their expected structure and the `call_indirect` calls within are correctly type-checked without causing unintended control flow exits.    **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: Tests control flow management in complex, nested structures involving conditional exits and function calls.
