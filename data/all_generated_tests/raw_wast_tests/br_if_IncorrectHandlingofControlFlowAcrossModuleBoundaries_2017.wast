;; 8. **Test Description:** Design a test where `br_if` branches into a `block` which calls an imported function leading to another `br_if` within nested blocks.    **Constraint Checked:** Correct relative and absolute stack handling with nested blocks and external calls.    **Relation:** Checks the maintenance of stack and control flow correctness when branching within nested blocks and calling external functions.
