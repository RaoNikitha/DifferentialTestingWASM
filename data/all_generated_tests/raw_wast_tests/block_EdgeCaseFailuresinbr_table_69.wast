;; 10. **Test with Shared Operand Stack across Nested Blocks**:    - Shared operand results across multiple nested blocks each containing `br_table` instructions targeting different block contexts.    - Checks detailed adherence to operand stack manipulations when `br_table` instructions operate within nested shared operand contexts.    - Edge Case: Wizard_engine's inline state operations might fail in maintaining a consistent stack state across multiple nested block transitions.  These tests are designed to expose differences in handling `br_table` edge cases in WebAssembly and wizard_engine due to improper state management and initialization handling by making focused, contextually demanding `block` instructions and index validation challenges.
