;; 4. **Stack Unwinding with Incorrect Branch**:    - **Description**: Test stack unwinding in a nested loop context where an incorrect branch during stack unwinding leads to execution jumping to the wrong loop level.    - **Constraint**: Ensuring operand stack unwinding correctly and accurately re-establishes the stack to the position when the loop was entered.
