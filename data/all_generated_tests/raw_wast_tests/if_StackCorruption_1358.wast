;; 9. **Test 9**: Generate an `if` instruction with a cycle in operand stack modification â€“ pushing values repeatedly in the `then` branch while the `else` branch performs underflowing operations causing deliberate mismatches, leading to stack height corruptions. These should especially be visible during forward branching validation.
