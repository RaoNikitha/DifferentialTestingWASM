;; 5. **Test Unwinding with Incorrect Operand Stack Height**:    - **Description**: When `br_if` branches, ensure that the operand stack height matches the required state.    - **Constraint**: The operand stack must reflect the types and order expected by the branch target after unwinding.    - **Incorrect Condition Evaluation**: The `br_if` encounters a stack height mismatch, leading to stack corruption or inaccurate condition evaluation.
