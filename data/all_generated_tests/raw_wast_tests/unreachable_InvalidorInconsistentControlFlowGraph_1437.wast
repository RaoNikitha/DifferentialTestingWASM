;; 8. Create a scenario where `unreachable` follows a br_if instruction, ensuring that the br_if branch correctly bypasses the unreachable if conditions are met, or traps otherwise.    - **Constraint:** Proper branch prediction and execution with immediate trap upon reaching `unreachable`.    - **CFG Check:** Check correct execution path based on conditionals leading to or bypassing `unreachable`.
