;; 6. **Test for Loop with Embedded `if-else` and `br` Instructions**:    Design a loop containing an `if-else` construct. Include a `br` in the `else` that targets the loop. Ensure the branching does not mistakenly exit the loop structure.    - **Constraint**: Validate loop scoping is maintained despite nested branching constructs.    - **Expectation**: Branch targets must respect the loopâ€™s scope continuously.
