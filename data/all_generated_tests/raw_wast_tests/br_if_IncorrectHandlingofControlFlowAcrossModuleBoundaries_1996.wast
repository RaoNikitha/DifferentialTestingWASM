;; 7. **Test: `br_if` with Unmatched Operand Stack Across Module Boundaries**    - **Constraint Checked:** Check error handling when the stack state expected by `br_if` in an imported function doesn't match the caller module's state.    - **Description:** Call an imported function with `br_if` in a block that expects a certain stack height and operand types, but mismatch on purpose. Expect and check error reporting for stack mismatch.
