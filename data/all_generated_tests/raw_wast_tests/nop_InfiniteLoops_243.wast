;; 4. **Test 4: Loop with Immediate Break and `nop`**:    - **Description**: A `loop` that includes `nop` instructions followed by a `br` instruction that immediately exits the loop.    - **Constraint**: Ensures `nop` doesnâ€™t prevent the loop from breaking immediately.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Detects if `nop` incorrectly causes continuance of the loop rather than breaking it.    - **Example**: `(loop $L (nop) (br $L) (nop))`
