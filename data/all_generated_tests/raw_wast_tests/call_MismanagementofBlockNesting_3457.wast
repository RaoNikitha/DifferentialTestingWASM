;; 6. **Br_Table within Nested Loops and Calls**:    - **Test Description**: Construct a scenario where a `br_table` instruction inside nested loops handles jumps to various depths with calls at each potential jump point. Verify that the correct block is exited.    - **Constraint Checked**: Proper jump handling and call execution within nested `br_table`.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: Tests handling of control jumps and calls within nested loop structures.
