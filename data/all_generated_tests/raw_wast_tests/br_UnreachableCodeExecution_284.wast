;; 5. **Backward Branch with Unmatched Operands:**    - Test Description: Implement a loop with non-matching operand types and include a `br` instruction with incorrect operand handling that causes the loop to continue erroneously and hit an `unreachable` instruction.    - Constraint: This ensures correct operand handling and type matching in backward branches targeting loops.
