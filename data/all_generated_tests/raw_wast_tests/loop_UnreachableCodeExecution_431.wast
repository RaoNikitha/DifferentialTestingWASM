;; 2. **Test Description**: Construct a loop which includes a conditional branch (`br_if`) where the false path contains an `unreachable` instruction.    - **Constraint**: Checks if the loop handles conditional branching correctly ensuring it does not inadvertently fall through to the `unreachable` code.    - **Unreachable Code Execution**: The branch condition should be properly evaluated to avoid reaching the `unreachable` instruction.
