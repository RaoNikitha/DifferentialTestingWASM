;; 6. Develop a test scenario where a `block` with a chain of push/pop instructions utilizes `br_if` to conditionally branch based on stack state. The objective is to verify if `wizard_engine` correctly adjusts the stack without corruption, especially when the context includes dynamically adjusted labels.
