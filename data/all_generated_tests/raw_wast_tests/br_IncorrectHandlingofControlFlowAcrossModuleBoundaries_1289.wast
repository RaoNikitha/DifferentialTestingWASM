;; 10. **Test Description:** Develop a WASM module where a function uses a `loop` containing a complex control flow with `if` and `block` statements. Perform `br` to loop's beginning, then make a call to an imported function having its nested control structures.     **Specific Constraint:** This tests operand stack consistency and branch correctness within complex loops.     **Relation to Control Flow Boundaries:** Ensures structural integrity and stack accuracy when looping back and crossing module boundaries involving nested controls.
