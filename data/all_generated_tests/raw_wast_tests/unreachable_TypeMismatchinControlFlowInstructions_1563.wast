;; 4. **Test 4: Nested Blocks with Unreachable and Type Conflicts**    - A nested `block` with an inner `block` containing an `unreachable`, leading to type expectations that conflict with the outer blockâ€™s signatures. This probes how nested contexts manage the type effects of traps.    - **Constraint Checked:** Observes type merging and expectation between nested control flow instructions containing `unreachable`.
