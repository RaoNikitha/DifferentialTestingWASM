;; 10. **Loop Block with Pre-Unreachable**:     - Develop a loop block where a branch exiting the loop hits `unreachable`.     - Ensures handling of loops, exit, and continuation correctness.     - If control flow incorrectly continues post-loop, `unreachable` is hit.  By designing these differential tests, you can specifically evaluate unreachable code execution, revealing any subtleties in error handling and control flow management differences between WebAssembly and wizard_engine implementations.
