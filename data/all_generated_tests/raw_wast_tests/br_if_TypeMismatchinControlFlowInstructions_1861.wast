;; - **Test 2**:   Use a `loop` with a `br_if` instruction that logically should push an `i64` result but mistakenly has an `f64` type.   - **Reason**: Loop constructs might misinterpret types pushed by branches.   - **Constraint**: The correct stack type `[t*]` must be maintained based on the loopâ€™s input type.
