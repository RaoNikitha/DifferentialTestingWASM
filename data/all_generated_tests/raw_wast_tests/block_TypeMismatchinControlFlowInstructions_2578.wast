;; 9. **Test Description**:    Develop a block `block` where intermediary instructions incorrectly modify the stack size and type, such as pushing `i64` after an expected `i32`. Validate if both implementations can rectify or flag the error.    **Constraint**: Operand stack states must remain compliant throughout block execution.    **Relation**: Tests dynamic type and stack state integrity within blocks.
