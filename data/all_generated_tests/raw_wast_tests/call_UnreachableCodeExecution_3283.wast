;; 2. **Test 2: Call with Insufficient Arguments**    - Create a test case where a function call is made with fewer arguments than are required by the called function's signature.    - **Specific Constraint**: This checks whether the stack properly handles underflow and how errors are presented, ensuring incorrect calls lead to 'unreachable' instructions or proper error handling.    - **Test Relation**: Incorrect stack manipulation could lead to an erroneous function call and potentially trigger an 'unreachable' instruction upon function invocation.
