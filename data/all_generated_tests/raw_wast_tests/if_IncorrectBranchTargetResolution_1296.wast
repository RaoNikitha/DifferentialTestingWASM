;; 7. **Test for Complex Nested Blocks with Multiple `if` Conditions**:    Assemble a series of nested blocks wherein each block contains various `if` conditions and corresponding `br` instructions. Ensure all branches resolve accurately to their intended targets.    - **Constraint**: Ensure correct branching amidst indeterminate levels of nested instructions.    - **Expectation**: Branch instructions jump precisely to scoped levels.
