;; 10. **Testing `nop` in Recursively Called Imported Functions**:    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures stack integrity during recursive calls with `nop`.    - **Description**: Import a function designed for recursion and place `nop` instructions at various points inside the recursive calls. Test for any stack inconsistencies or errors during deep recursive calls involving `nop`.
