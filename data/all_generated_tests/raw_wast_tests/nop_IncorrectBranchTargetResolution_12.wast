;; 3. **Multiple Consecutive `nop` with Conditional Branching**: Design a sequence involving multiple consecutive `nop` instructions interspersed with conditional branching (`br_if`). Ensure that `br_if` targets the accurate block and test if the no-operations (NOPs) introduce incorrect branch resolution.
