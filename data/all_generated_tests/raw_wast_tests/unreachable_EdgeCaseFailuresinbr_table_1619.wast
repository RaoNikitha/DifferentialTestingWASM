;; 10. **Test Description:**     A `br_table` instruction driven by a variable index in a branching scenario that guarantees some paths always lead to an `unreachable` while others are valid to induce traps selectively.    **Constraint Checked:** Examines handling and trapping based on selective branching paths in `br_table`.    **Edge Case Relation:** Ensures selective path-triggered traps within `br_table` logic.
