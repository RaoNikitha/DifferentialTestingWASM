;; 8. **Mismatched Block Conclusion**:    - **Description**: Conditionally branch to an `if` block designed to produce `i32`, using a `br_if` that expects `f64`.    - **Constraint**: Validates that different control flow paths adhere to output type expectations.    - **Differential Behavior**: WASM fails due to type incompatibility, wizard_engine potentially creates invalid state references.
