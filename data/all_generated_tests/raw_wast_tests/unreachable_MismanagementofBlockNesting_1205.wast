;; 6. **Test Description:**    A function that involves an immediate `unreachable` followed by a heavily nested control flow including both valid and invalid `br` instructions.    - **Constraint Checked:** Ensures that all nested control flow instructions post `unreachable` are invalidated and do not incorrectly alter control structures.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting:** Verifies that the trap prevents the mismanagement of nested block control flow by prepared nested `br` instructions.
