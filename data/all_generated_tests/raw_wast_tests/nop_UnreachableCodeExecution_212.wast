;; 3. **Test 3**:     - Description: Use a combination of `br_if` branching instructions with `nop` scattered before a critical `unreachable` branch. Analyze if `nop` sequences misdirect flow to the `unreachable`.    - Constraint: Verifying that `nop` integrated with conditional branches does not lead to unintended `unreachable` execution.
