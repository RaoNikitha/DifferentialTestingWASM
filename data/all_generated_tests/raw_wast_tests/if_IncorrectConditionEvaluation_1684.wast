;; 5. **Test `if` Instruction with Zero Boundary Condition**:    - Description: Execute an `if` statement that checks operand boundary values, especially where `i32` is exactly zero, positive one, and negative one.    - Constraint: Verifies precise boundary condition handling around zero for condition evaluation.    - Incorrect Condition Evaluation: Ensures Wizard Engine does not mistakenly treat values around boundaries incorrectly impacting branch selection.
