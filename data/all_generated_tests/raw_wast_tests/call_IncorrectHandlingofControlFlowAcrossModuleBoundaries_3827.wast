;; 6. **Calling Imported Function in a Loop**:    - **Description**: Execute a loop within one module that repeatedly calls a function imported from another module, and ensure that the control flow remains consistent during each iteration.    - **Constraint**: Loop control flow must not corrupt the stack.    - **Relation**: Tests if repeated imports in a loop across module boundaries maintain correct execution flow.
