;; 10. **Test Empty Operand Provisioning on Forward Branching**:    - **Description**: Invoke `br_if` targeting a `block` but provide an incorrect operand stack setup.    - **Constraint**: Operand provision must unwind and reconstruct the stack appropriately for the branch target.    - **Incorrect Condition Evaluation**: The forward branch enacted by `br_if` faces improper operand management leading to a structural inconsistency.
