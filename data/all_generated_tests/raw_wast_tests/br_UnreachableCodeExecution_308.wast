;; 9. **Test Description:**    - A nested `block` structure where a `br` instruction targets a label with operand type mismatch, expect control flow to lead to `unreachable`.    - **Constraint: Result Type Matching**    - **Differential Behavior: The Wizard Engine should verify the operand types, whereas WebAssembly might bypass this check leading to erroneous `unreachable` execution.**
