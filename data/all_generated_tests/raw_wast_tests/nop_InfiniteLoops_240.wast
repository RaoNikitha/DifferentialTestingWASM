;; 1. **Test 1: Simple Infinite Loop with Nested `nop`**:    - **Description**: A loop repeatedly executes a sequence containing only the `nop` instruction. This ensures that the loop control flow is maintained without doing any work.    - **Constraint**: Loop should terminate correctly after a set number of iterations or continue infinitely if the termination condition is flawed.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Checks if improper handling of `nop` affects the loopâ€™s termination condition.    - **Example**: `(loop $L (nop) (br_if $L (i32.const 1)))`

 ;; (module (func (loop $L (nop) (br_if $L (i32.const 1)))))
