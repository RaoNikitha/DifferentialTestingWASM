;; 2. **Test `br_if` with Simple False Condition:**    - A conditional branch `br_if` with a simple condition that evaluates to false. Check if the branch is not taken in both implementations.    - Constraint Checked: Correct evaluation of the false condition in `br_if`.    - Relation: Ensures `br_if` does not branch when condition is false.
