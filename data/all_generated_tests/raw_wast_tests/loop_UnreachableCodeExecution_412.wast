;; 3. **Test Description**: A loop containing a `br_if` at the beginning that conditionally skips the rest of the loop body and goes to an `unreachable` due to a misinterpreted branch table:    - **Constraint Checked**: Proper handling of `br_if` and branch table validation.    - **Unreachable Code Execution**: Incorrectly evaluated conditional branches could cause the program to reach `unreachable`.
