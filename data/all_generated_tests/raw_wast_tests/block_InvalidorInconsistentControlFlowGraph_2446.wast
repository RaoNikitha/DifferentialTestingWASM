;; 7. **Test Incomplete Block Type Mismatches**:    - Description: Use a block with an incomplete or incorrectly specified block type that does not match the inner instructions.    - Constraint: Check if the implementation adheres to block type constraints accurately.    - CFG Relevance: Incorrect block types can result in invalid state transitions within the CFG.
