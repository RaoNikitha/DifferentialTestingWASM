;; - **Test 6**:   Design a function with a `loop` that includes a `br_if` instruction that breaks out with a type incompatible with the loopâ€™s expected input type.   - **Reason**: Checks backward branches in loops for type consistency.   - **Constraint**: The loop input type must match values pushed upon breaking.
