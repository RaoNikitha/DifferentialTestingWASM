;; 8. **Test 8**: Implement a loop with `br_table` where the label vector has duplicate indices. Verify that the branching to duplicate labels maintains the stack integrity.    - **Constraint**: Ensures label indices in the vector are handled consistently.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Inconsistent handling of duplicates can cause loops to not terminate.
