;; 8. **Test Description**: Implement a loop where a branch outside the loop re-enters at an invalid point, overcoming stack unwinding steps and encountering an `unreachable`.    - **Constraint**: Assures correct stack unwinding behavior, specifically in the handling of back-jumps and branches.    - **Unreachable Code Execution**: Incorrect stack unwinding brings execution to `unreachable` unexpectedly.
