;; 10. **Test 10: Operand Stack Mismatch in Block with `nop`**     - Insert a `nop` within a block followed by an instruction that improperly pops from the operand stack resulting in a mismatch.     - **Constraint**: `nop` should not affect stack state assumptions before operand pop.     - **Type Mismatch Check**: Ensures blockâ€™s operand stack state remains coherent in presence of `nop`.
