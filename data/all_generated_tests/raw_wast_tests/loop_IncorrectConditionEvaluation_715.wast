;; 6. **Loop with Type Conversion Affecting Condition**    - Test a loop where a type conversion instruction (e.g., `i32.wrap_i64`) influences the condition for `br_if`. Confirm the branch is taken only when the conversion results in zero.    - **Reason**: Validates the loopâ€™s handling of type conversion instructions affecting the branching condition.
