;; 2. **Test Description:** Test `br_if` instruction with a false condition (zero value) to ensure the branch is not taken and execution continues. A failure here suggests improper handling of false conditions.    - **Specific Constraint:** Confirm execution continuity with false conditional values.    - **Relation to Incorrect Condition Evaluation:** Validates that branches are not taken for false conditions.
