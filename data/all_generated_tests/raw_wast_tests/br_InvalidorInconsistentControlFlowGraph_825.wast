;; 6. **Test for Stack Polymorphism:**    - **Description**: A `br` in different stack conditions including before and after consuming operands to exercise stack-polymorphism behavior.    - **Constraint Checked**: Verifying `br` as stack-polymorphic.    - **Relation to CFG**: Ensures `br` maintains CFG validity across various stack configurations.
