;; 3. **Test for Conditional Branching based on Stack Top Value within Loop**    - **Description**: Insert a `br_if` instruction inside a loop that evaluates a condition based on the top value of the operand stack, expecting the branch not to occur if the value is 0.    - **Constraint Checked**: Ensures stack top value condition is correctly evaluated.    - **Incorrect Condition Evaluation**: Checks if the `br_if` instruction erroneously branches regardless of the stack top value.
