;; 1. **Test 1: Mismatched Label Arity in Loops**    - **Description**: Create a loop containing a `br_table` instruction with labels of differing arity. The loop should be configured to run indefinitely due to an internal condition on `br_if` that always evaluates to true.    - **Constraint**: This test checks for the strict enforcement of consistent label arity.     - **Infinite Loop Relation**: Improper handling of the arity mismatch can prevent the loop from exiting correctly, leading to an infinite loop.
