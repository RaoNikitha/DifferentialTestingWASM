;; 8. **Test Description:**    - Use a control structure containing nested `block`, `loop`, and `if` constructs, with a `br` instruction targeting the `loop` from within the `if` body.    - **Constraint:** Validate that the branch correctly jumps to the start of the `loop`, skipping the `if` structureâ€™s remaining instructions.    - **CFG Check:** Ensures the CFG accurately maps the interactions between mixed control constructs and resolves branch targets correctly.
