;; 10. **Test Description**: Set up a loop that makes indirect calls using `call_indirect` to functions that each modify a stack variable involved in the main loop exit condition. The loop should exit when the stack variable hits a threshold, but improper operand handling causes this value to become corrupt.     - **Constraint Being Checked**: Accurate stack state management and value preservation across indirect calls.     - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Corruption of stack state causes the loop exit condition to never be satisfied, leading to infinite loops.
