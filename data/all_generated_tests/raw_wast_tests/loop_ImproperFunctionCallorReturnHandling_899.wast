;; 10. **Function Call within Loop Modifying Type Stack**:     - Description: Design a loop where `call` instructions modify the type stack, followed by an instruction that relies on the modified stack for further calls.     - Constraint: Ensure the type stack modifications by calls within the loop are correctly handled and maintained.     - Relation: Incorrect type stack management can lead to invalid function calls and disrupted control flow.
