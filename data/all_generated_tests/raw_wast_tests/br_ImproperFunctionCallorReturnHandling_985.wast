;; 6. **Test: Conditional Branching with Function Calls**    - **Description**: Implement conditional branches (`if` instruction) within a function. The branches navigate different paths including another function call. Return from the function should contain a `br` instruction that verifies if the operand stack is correctly managed.    - **Constraint Checked**: Checks correct path execution and stack operations for conditionally branched paths with function calls.    - **Improper Handling Aspect**: Incorrect path execution or branch due to mismanaged stack height or state.
