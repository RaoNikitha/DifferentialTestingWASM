;; 7. **Incorrect Condition Propagation in Loop**    - Design a loop where a condition is computed in one iteration and should influence a `br_if` in subsequent iterations. Verify the propagation of the correct condition value between iterations.    - **Reason**: Checks that the condition value is correctly stored and propagated to subsequent iterations for accurate `br_if` branching.
