;; 6. **Test Description**: Add a block that logically results in stack underflow by having fewer initial stack values than required by the block type and execute code that depends on a minimally populated stack.    - **Constraint**: Ensures that initial stack states are validated against block type requirements.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption**: Missing initial stack values will expose improper stack checks and handling, leading to corruption.
