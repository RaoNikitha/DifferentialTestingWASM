;; 4. **Test Description:**    A block with a nested loop where `br_if` uses an invalid condition based on uninitialized local variables.      **Constraint Checked:** Operand stack handling and context extension validity.      **Relation to Infinite Loops:** Validates the handling of blocks when faced with incorrect conditions that could cause infinite looping.
