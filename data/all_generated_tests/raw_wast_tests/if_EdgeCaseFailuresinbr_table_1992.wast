;; 3. **Test Description**: Test `if` with a false branch leading to deeply nested `br_table` instructions with all targets exceeding bounds.    - **Constraint**: Validates that the false path of the `if` block handles deep nesting and out-of-bounds `br_table` targets.    - **Relation to Edge Case**: Probes the robustness of the control flow in handling more complex branching structures and improper target references.
