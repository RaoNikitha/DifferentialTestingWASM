;; 5. **Cross-Module Calls with Varied Stack Depth**:    - **Reasoning**: This test checks the resilience of handling control flow when there are significant variations in stack depth due to cross-module calls.    - **Description**: Create multiple modules with deeply nested function calls, including calls to imported functions that affect stack depth significantly. Validate that stack depth adjustments are correctly managed between the modules.
