;; 7. **Test Description**: Implement a scenario where a `br_if` is used in a function with valid function cardinality, but incorrect conditional branch management results in stack operand misalignment, triggering a generic or specific error message.   - **Constraint Being Checked**: Consistent execution of branch conditions to maintain stack alignment for functions.   - **Stack Corruption Aspect**: Misalignment of operands on the stack due to incorrect branch handling affects function execution and return value integrity.
