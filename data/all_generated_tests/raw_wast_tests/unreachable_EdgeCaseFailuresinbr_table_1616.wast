;; 7. **Test Description:**     A `br_table` within a function that has its indices altered by a complex sequence of stack operations, followed by `unreachable` to check for consistent trapping at unpredictable index values.    **Constraint Checked:** Checks how complex index value generation for `br_table` with subsequent `unreachable` enforces traps.    **Edge Case Relation:** Ensures unpredictably generated indices correctly trigger traps.
