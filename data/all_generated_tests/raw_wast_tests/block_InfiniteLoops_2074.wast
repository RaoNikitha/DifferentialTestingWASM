;; 5. **Test Description:**    A block with nested blocks and an inner loop using `br_if` on stack slots not properly managed, leading to an infinite loop.      **Constraint Checked:** Stack management and tracking within nested blocks and loops.      **Relation to Infinite Loops:** Ensures correct handling of stack slots to prevent mismanagement leading to unintentional infinite loops.
