;; 9. Construct a nested structure with an `if-else` inside a `loop`, and place a `br` instruction within the `else` branch to target an outer block. Ensure the branch properly exits the `loop` and continues past the outer blockâ€™s `end`. This validates correct execution flow from nested conditional branches within loops.
