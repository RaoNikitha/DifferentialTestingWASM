;; 2. **Test Case 2**:    - **Description**: Establish a `loop` control with an input type of `f32` and use `br_if` with a condition of type `i32` to jump to the beginning of the loop. This tests whether the `br_if` correctly identifies the loop's input type and handles the conditional branch accordingly.    - **Constraint**: Validates that control flow correctly identifies target block types, flagging errors where input stack types are incorrectly managed.
