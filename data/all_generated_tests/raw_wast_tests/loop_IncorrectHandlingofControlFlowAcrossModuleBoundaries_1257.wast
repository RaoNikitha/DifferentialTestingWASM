;; 8. **Loop with Conditional Exit to Imported Function**:    - Test a loop with a conditional exit (`br_if`) that branches out to an imported function. Ensure the correct control flow is maintained and the loop exits properly without corrupting the stack.    - **Constraint**: Verifies the correct conditional execution and proper handling of stack when transitioning to imported functions.
