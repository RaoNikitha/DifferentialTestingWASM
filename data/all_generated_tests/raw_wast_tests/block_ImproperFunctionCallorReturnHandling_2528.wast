;; 9. **Function Call with Incorrect Label Indexing**:    - **Description**: Include a `call` instruction within a block that should target a labeled block, testing if label indexing is maintained correctly during the call.    - **Constraint**: Ensure labels are correctly indexed and managed in function calls.    - **Improper Handling**: Labels may get mismanaged during calls, leading to incorrect function execution paths.
