;; 6. **Test Description**:     - Generate a deeply nested set of loops with a `br_if` targeting the innermost loop with a true condition.    - **Constraint Checking**: Examines the effective handling and resolution of deep label propagation and accurate loop continuation.    - **Infinite Loop Relation**: Prevents inner loop conditions from forcing outer loops into unbreakable loops, confirming the deep nesting handling is correct.
