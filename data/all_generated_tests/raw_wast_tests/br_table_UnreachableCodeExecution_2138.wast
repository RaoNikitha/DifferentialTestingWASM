;; 8. **Test with External Function in Stack Management:**    - Description: Mimic the behavior of `wizard_engine` by involving custom external functions for stack operations and `br_table` management.    - Constraint Checked: Integration and correctness of external functions.    - Relates to Unreachable Code Execution: Errors in custom function handling can cause the execution of `unreachable` instructions due to incorrect branches.
