;; 9. **Test Description 9**: Define a multilevel control flow with alternating `block` and `loop`, each with distinct input and output types. Use `br_if` to interact conditionally among them. Specifically test if `wizard_engine` properly adjusts based on whether the target is a `loop` or a `block`.
