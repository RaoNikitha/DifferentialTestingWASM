;; 9. **Test 9: Function Call Inside Try-Catch with Argument Drop**      Description: Develop a function where a `call` instruction is placed inside a `try` block, and an exception leads to a `catch` block that drops arguments from the stack. Verify how each implementation handles arguments in the presence of exceptions.      Constraint: Simulate exceptions that lead to stack mutations.      Relation to Branch Target Resolution: Exception handling affects control flow branches and stack state, testing resilience to label resolution under exceptional circumstances.
