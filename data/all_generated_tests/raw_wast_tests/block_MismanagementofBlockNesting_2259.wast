;; 10. **Test Description**: Program a scenario of nested blocks where an inner block contains a misnested `br` that attempts to prematurely exit to an outer non-existent label depth. Confirm proper error or resolution handling.    - **Constraint**: Ensure correct error handling and depth-checking for premature and incorrect branch exits.    - **Nesting Mismanagement Check**: Tests if misnested blocks are accurately detected and handled, providing proper error or safe resolution.
