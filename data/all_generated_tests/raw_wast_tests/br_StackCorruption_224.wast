;; 5. **Test Multiple Br Instructions to Loop Start:**    - **Description:** Have multiple `br` instructions within a loop that branch back to the loopâ€™s start.    - **Reasoning:** This test checks for correct stack behavior with multiple backward branches.    - **Constraint:** Ensure backward branches maintain correct operand order and stack height.    - **Relation to Stack Corruption:** Incorrect stack management in backward branches can lead to corrupted input values on loop iterations.
