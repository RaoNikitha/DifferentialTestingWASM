;; 2. **Test 2: Loop with Conditional Forward Branch to Imported Function**    - **Description**: Construct a loop that conditionally executes a branch (`br_if`) to an imported function. Ensure the transition, including the operand stack unwinding, is correctly maintained by both implementations while checking for differential behavior in operand stack handling.
