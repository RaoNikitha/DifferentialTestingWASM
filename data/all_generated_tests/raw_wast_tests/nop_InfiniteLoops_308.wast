;; 9. **Testing Loop Initialization with Alternating Nop and Functional Instructions**:    - Within a loop, alternate `nop` instructions with functional operations (e.g., arithmetic). Ensure `wizard_engine` initializes the context correctly to prevent infinite loops.    - Constraint: `nop` should not affect execution of functional instructions or exit conditions.
