;; 9. **Test 9: Try-Catch Result Type Mismatch**:    - **Test Description**: Implement a try-catch block where the call within the try block has a return type differing from the expected catch block type.    - **Constraint**: Ensure that the result types between try and catch blocks are consistent, even with function calls.    - **Type Mismatch**: The type inconsistency due to the call should trigger an error.
