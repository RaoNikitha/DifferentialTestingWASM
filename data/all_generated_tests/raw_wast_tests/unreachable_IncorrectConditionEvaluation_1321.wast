;; 2. **Test Description:**    - Define a loop with a `br_if` that should exit the loop, but place `unreachable` immediately after a condition that evaluates to false. Verify that the loop is not exited prematurely.    - Constraint: Verifies the engine handles loop exit conditions correctly.    - Relation to Incorrect Condition Evaluation: Misinterpreted condition might incorrectly take the branch leading to unexpected `unreachable`.
