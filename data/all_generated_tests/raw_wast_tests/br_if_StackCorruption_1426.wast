;; 7. **Test Description**:     Implement a `block` with a `br_if` referencing an invalid label depth in the wizard_engine while within bounds in WASM. Observe the behavior difference to check label bounds in wizard_engine.    - **Constraint Checked**: Out-of-bounds label access prevention.    - **Stack Corruption Check**: Ensures that invalid labels do not manipulate the stack unexpectedly.
