;; 5. **Test Description:**    Use a `br` instruction within a `block` that contains multiple `if` statements, targeting a label after the block.    **Constraint Checked:** Correct stack unwinding through nested control flow and restoration after `if` blocks.    **Relation to Stack Corruption:** Errors during complex flow unwinding could lead to stack corruption due to underflow or overflow.
