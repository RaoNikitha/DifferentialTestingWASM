;; 10. **Test Description:**     - Design a complex module with multiple nested `block` and `loop` structures, where `br` instructions within `block` attempt to manipulate the operand stack with mismatched types like providing an `i32` where an `f32` is expected.     - **Constraint Check:** This test validates comprehensive type enforcement across deeply nested control flows, ensuring branches maintain exact type compliance.     - **Differential Behavior:** While WebAssembly should enforce strict type checks and prevent type mismatches, Wizard Engineâ€™s detailed validation might overlook mismatched types in complex nesting scenarios.
