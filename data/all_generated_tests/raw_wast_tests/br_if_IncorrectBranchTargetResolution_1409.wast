;; 10. **Test Description**: Set up a `block` containing a nested `if` and `loop`, with a `br_if` targeting the outer `block` based on a condition in `loop`. Validate forward jump to outer block.     - **Constraint Checked**: Ensuring forward jumps correctly resolve outer `block` label.     - **Related Issue**: Confirming that nested loop and if conditions do not mislead outer block targeting.
