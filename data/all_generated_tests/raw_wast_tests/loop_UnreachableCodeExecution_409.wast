;; 10. **Unreachable Following Failed Type Check**:     Implement a loop where the operand stack undergoes type transformations inside which type mismatches would lead to an `unreachable` instruction termination. Test if type checks are enforced before reaching the `unreachable`.  These differential tests focus on how different implementations manage operand stacks, branching instructions, and type checks. Proper validation ensures correct instruction behavior, catching potential traps due to reaching the `unreachable` instruction. Each ensures precise control flow handling and operand management, revealing discrepancies by leading to unexpected unreachable code execution.
