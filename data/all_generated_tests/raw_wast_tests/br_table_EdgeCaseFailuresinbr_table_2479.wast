;; 9. **Test Description:**    Use a br_table instruction with varied operand types in a mixed operand environment to see if the correct and intended unwinding is maintained, especially focusing on multi-type stack conditions.    - **Specific Constraint:** Validation of type constraint adherence and stack management.    - **Edge Case Relation:** Type-mismatch mishandling can lead to state inconsistencies.
