;; - **Test 5**:    Implement a loop with a complex branching table (`br_table`) that should handle different branch targets including a branch back to the loop itself under incorrect bounds handling.     Constraint: `br_table` indirect branch without breaking.     Relation: Handling infinite loops through mismanaged indirect branching targets.
