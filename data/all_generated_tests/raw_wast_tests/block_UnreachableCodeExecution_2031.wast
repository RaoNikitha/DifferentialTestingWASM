;; 2. **Branch to Nonexistent Label**:    - Create a block with instructions containing a branch targeting a label that does not exist. Immediately after, place an `unreachable` instruction.    - The test ensures proper error handling for invalid branch targets.    - If an incorrect branch resolves and bypasses error handling, itâ€™ll reach the `unreachable` instruction.
