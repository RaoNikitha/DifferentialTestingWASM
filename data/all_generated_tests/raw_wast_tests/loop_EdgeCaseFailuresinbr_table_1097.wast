;; 8. **Test Description**:     Create a loop block with an immediate `br_table` instruction that has an out-of-bounds index and directly follow it with another control instruction (e.g., another loop or block). The test checks for ensuring the appropriate execution flow.    **Constraint**: Verify abrupt default branching mid-loop doesnâ€™t disrupt subsequent instructions.    **Relation to `br_table` Edge Cases**: Ensures there are no execution pauses or skips after a default branch is chosen.
