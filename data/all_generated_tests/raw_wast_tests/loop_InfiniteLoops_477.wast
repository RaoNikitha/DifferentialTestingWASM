;; 8. **Test Description**: Craft a `loop` where the control is dynamically altered within the loop body, potentially modifying the loop condition improperly and causing an infinite loop.    **Constraint**: Checking dynamic control modifications within loops.    **Infinite Loop Relevance**: Prevents changes in control flow from causing non-terminating loops.
