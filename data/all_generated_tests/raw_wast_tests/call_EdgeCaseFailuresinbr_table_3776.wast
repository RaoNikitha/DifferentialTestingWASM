;; 5. **Test Description**: Create a scenario where `br_table` targets overlap with valid indices but lead to an out-of-bounds index in certain execution orderings. Check the engines' robustness in consistent error detection.    - **Specific Constraint**: Validate proper handling of varying target indices within `br_table`.    - **Relation to `call`**: Testing the robustness of call error handling in different execution paths and orders.
