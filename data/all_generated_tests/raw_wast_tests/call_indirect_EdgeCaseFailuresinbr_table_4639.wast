;; 8. **Test for Immediate Cycle in `br_table` with Consecutive `call_indirect`**:    - Create an immediate cycle in the target list of `br_table` and verify handling of an immediate call to `call_indirect` in the cycle.    - Constraint: Immediate cyclic behavior in branching.    - Relation: Checks robustness in cyclic conditions impacting indirect calls.
