;; 3. **Test Unreachable Code Execution with Invalid Operand Stack**:    - **Description**: Execute a call_indirect instruction where the operand stack does not have sufficient values as required by the function signature.    - **Constraint Checked**: Validate correct handling of operand stack requirements.    - **Relation to Unreachable**: Ensures that lack of required operands does not result in reaching an 'unreachable' instruction erroneously.
