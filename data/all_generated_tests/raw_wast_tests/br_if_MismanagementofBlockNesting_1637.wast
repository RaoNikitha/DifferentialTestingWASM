;; 8. **Incorrect Operand Count Test**:    - **Description**: Define blocks with mismatched operand counts between a `br_if` and the block's required types in a nested structure. This tests if the stack state is validated correctly on branch targets.    - **Constraint Checked**: Operand Stack.    - **Expected Failure**: wizard_engine will likely signal `EmptyValueStackExpecting` if mismatched operand counts are not correctly handled.
