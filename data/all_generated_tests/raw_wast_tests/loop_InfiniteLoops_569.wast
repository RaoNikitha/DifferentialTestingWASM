;; 10. **Test Name: Infinite Loop with Stack Interaction**     - **Description**: Design a loop that continuously manipulates the stack, ensuring the branch instruction at the end evaluates to loop back indefinitely.     - **Constraint Checked**: Proper stack unwinding and operand handling that propagates back into the loop.     - **Infinite Loop Relation**: Operand consumption and stack interaction continue to loop indefinitely.
