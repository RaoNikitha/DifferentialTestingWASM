;; 10. **Test: Improper Mismatched `end` Label**:    - **Description**: Create an `if` block concluding with a `br` instruction targeting a scope resolved incorrectly due to mismatched `end` labels.    - **Constraint**: Ensures `end` pseudo-instruction validates enclosing blocks accurately.    - **Relation to Branch Target Resolution**: Validates if branch target resolution is consistent with the structured control end label evaluations.
