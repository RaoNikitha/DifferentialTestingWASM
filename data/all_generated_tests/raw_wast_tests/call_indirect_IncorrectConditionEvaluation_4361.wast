;; 10. **Test Description**: Perform a `call_indirect` meant to exceed table bounds, followed by `br_if` to handle branch condition based on successfully detecting and handling out-of-bounds trap conditions.      **Specific Constraint**: Properly managing table bounds checks and out-of-bounds conditions.      **Incorrect Condition Evaluation**: Verify if `br_if` accurately handles and evaluates conditions leading to out-of-bounds traps.
