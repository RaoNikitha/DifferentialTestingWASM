;; 6. **Forward Branch Type Compliance**:    - **Description**: Create `br_if` to jump forward to a block that consumes `i32` and `i64`, but provide only `i32`.    - **Constraint**: Ensures forward jumps properly comply with expected input types.    - **Differential Behavior**: WASM halts on mismatch, while incorrect stack management in wizard_engine might allow faulty execution.
