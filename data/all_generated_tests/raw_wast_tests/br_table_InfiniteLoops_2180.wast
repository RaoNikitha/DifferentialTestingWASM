;; 10. **Test 10**: Design a loop that misaligns operand stack state intentionally before the `br_table` instruction. Verify the loop can still exit correctly by resetting the stack appropriately for the label target.     - **Constraint**: Ensures stack-polymorphism and operand type integrity are respected.     - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Mismanagement here can cause the loop to loop infinitely.
