;; 2. **Invalid Operand Consumption**:    Design a loop that starts with mismatched operand stack requirements, such as needing to pop more operands than present on the stack.    Constraint: Validate stack unwinding behavior when operand requirements are mismatched.    Expected: Proper error detection for operand stack inconsistencies should prevent the loop from executing.
