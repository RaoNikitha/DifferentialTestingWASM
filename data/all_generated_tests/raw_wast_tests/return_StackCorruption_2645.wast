;; 4. **Test with Control Flow Inside a Block**    - Incorporate loops or conditional branches inside a function's block that perform several stack operations.    - Check that the return unwinds correctly from both the current block and intermediate control flow blocks.    - Relates to proper stack unwinding and confirms that inner control flow does not corrupt outermost return stack state.
