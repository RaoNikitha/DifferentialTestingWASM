;; 6. **Excessive Operands Before Indirect Call Test**:    - **Description**: Prepare more operands on the stack than required by the `call_indirect` function type and execute the instruction.    - **Constraint Check**: Only the needed operands should be consumed.    - **Stack Corruption Check**: Ensure that the remaining operands on the stack are correctly positioned post-call.
