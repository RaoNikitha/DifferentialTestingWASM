;; - **Test 9**:    Design a loop driven by a counter that wraps around (e.g., incrementing up to the max value of an integer type), ensuring the condition to break the loop never succeeds after wrap around.     Constraint: Counter overflow causing indefinite loop.     Relation: Ensures correct handling of counter-based loop exit condition.
