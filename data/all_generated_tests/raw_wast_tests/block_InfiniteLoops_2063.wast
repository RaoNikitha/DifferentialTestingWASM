;; 4. **Test Description:** Define a `block` with an inner `loop` and incorrectly implement the `br` instruction to exit the loop early.     - **Constraint Checked:** Verifies the accuracy of block segmentation and instruction sequence validity.     - **Infinite Loop Relation:** If `br` fails to exit the loop as expected, it may cause the loop to run indefinitely.
