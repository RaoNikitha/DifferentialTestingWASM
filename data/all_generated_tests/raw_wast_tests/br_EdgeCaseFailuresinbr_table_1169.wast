;; 10. **Test for Mixed Mode Block Types:**     - Combine `br_table` targets that transition between `block`, `loop`, and `if-else` structures managed by different operands and target combinations.       - **Constraint Checked:** Validates branch target resolution across mixed mode control structures and ensuring operand compliance.       - **Edge Case Insight:** Checks comprehensive handling across varying control flow structures within a `br_table`.
