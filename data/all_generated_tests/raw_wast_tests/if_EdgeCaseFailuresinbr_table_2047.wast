;; 8. **Test Description**:     Implement an `if` block with an empty `then` branch and an `else` branch containing a `br_table` instruction with both valid and out-of-bounds indices.    **Constraint**: Tests mixing valid and invalid `br_table` entries within the same instruction in the `else` branch.    **Edge Case Relation**: Checks for differential treatment of mixed validity indices in `br_table` within conditional branches.
