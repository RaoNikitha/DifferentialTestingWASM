;; 9. **Test Description:**    Construct a function containing nested `if` conditions and loops, placing `unreachable` within the most deeply nested condition and verify loop continuation using `br`.    *Constraint Checked:* Verification of immediate trap when `unreachable` is reached inside deeply nested conditions.    *Mismanagement Focus:* Incorrect continuation or exit of loops and blocks upon `unreachable` execution.
