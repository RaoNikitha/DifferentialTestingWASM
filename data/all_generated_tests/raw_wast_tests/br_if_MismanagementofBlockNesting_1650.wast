;; 1. **Test Description**: Execute a `br_if` within a deeply nested structure with multiple `block` and `if` control instructions. Ensure the `br_if` targets the innermost block, validating correct stack unwinding and label indexing at this complex nested level.    - **Constraint Checked**: Correct label indexing and stack management when targeting deeply nested blocks.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: Misaligned index interpretation may cause branching to the incorrect block.
