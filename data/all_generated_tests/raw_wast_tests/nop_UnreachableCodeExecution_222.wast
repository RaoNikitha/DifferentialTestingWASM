;; 3. **Test Case 3: Sequence of `nop` instructions leading to `unreachable`:**    - **Constraint Checked:** Ensuring multiple `nop` instructions do not affect control flow and stack.    - **Expected Behavior:** Execution should hit the `unreachable` eventually, causing a trap.    - **Differential Behavior:** Improper handling in wizard_engine could mismanage stack or initialization leading to a non-trap situation.
