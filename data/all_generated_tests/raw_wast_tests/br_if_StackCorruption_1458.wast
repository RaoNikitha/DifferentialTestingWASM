;; 9. **Test Description**: Design a test that runs multiple operations, including a function that should break out of a `block` using `br_if`. Ensure there's an index misinterpretation to trigger either an `OobLabel` error or stack mismanagement in the `wizard_engine`.   - **Constraint Being Checked**: Accurate label index interpretation and stack adherence.   - **Stack Corruption Aspect**: Inaccurate label targeting leading to unplanned stack conditions, leaving residual or missing values affecting subsequent operations.
