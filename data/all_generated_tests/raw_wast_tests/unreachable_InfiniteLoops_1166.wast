;; 7. **Test Description:**     - Implement a loop containing multiple `unreachable` instructions interspersed with `br_if` to break the loop.    - **Constraint:** Confirm that each `unreachable` leads to an immediate trap and interrupts further execution.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops:** Improper tracking and handling of `unreachable` may allow the loop to run indefinitely.    - **Expected Behavior:** Trap should occur due to `unreachable`.
