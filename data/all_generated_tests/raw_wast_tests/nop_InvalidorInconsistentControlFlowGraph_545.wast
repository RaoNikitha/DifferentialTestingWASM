;; 6. **Test Description**:    - Place `nop` instructions at every possible position inside a function and at the beginning and end of the function. Check for differences in context initialization.    - **Constraint Checked**: Guarantees that `nop` instructions neither alter the execution flow nor the context preconditions.    - **Relation to CFG**: Ensures the initial and final CFG states remain unaffected by `nop`.
