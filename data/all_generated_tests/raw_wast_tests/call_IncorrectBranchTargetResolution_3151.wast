;; 10. **Test 10**: Develop a function composed of a complex control flow with multiple nested `if` and `else` statements, which incorrectly uses `br` instructions to jump to non-existent blocks. Call this function and assess the difference in behavior between WebAssembly and Wizard_engine on detecting and handling the invalid branch targets.  **Each of these test descriptions targets different aspects of Incorrect Branch Target Resolution, ensuring comprehensive differential testing of WebAssembly and Wizard_engine implementations based on their handling of call instructions and branching behaviors.**
