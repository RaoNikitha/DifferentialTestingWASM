;; 5. **Test Description**: Place `nop` between combinations of `block`, `loop`, `if`, and `else` structures, checking if all entry and exit points are properly recognized.    **Constraint Checked**: Mixing control constructs with `nop` maintains flow integrity.    **Relation to CFG**: Ensures control structuresâ€™ entry/exit are correctly identified amidst multiple `nops`.
