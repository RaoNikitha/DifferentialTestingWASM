;; 10. **Repeated Function Index Call**:    Use `call_indirect` repeatedly with a valid function index but with dynamic condition checks (`br_if` and other conditions) in the table to ensure correct handling over multiple executions and conditional evaluations.      **Constraint**: Check consistent handling of dynamic lookups and conditional execution paths.
