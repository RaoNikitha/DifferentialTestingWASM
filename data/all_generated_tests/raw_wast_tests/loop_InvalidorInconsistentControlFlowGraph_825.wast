;; 6. **Conditional Loop Entry with br_if**:    - Design a loop where entry depends on a `br_if` branching past the loop under certain conditions. Ensure context setup reflects both entry and bypass scenarios.    - **Constraint**: Properly manage stack and context setup for conditional loop entries.    - **CFG Check**: Confirm the CFG includes both the entry and the bypass paths.
