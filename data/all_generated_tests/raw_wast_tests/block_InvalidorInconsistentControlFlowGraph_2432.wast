;; 3. **Test for Incorrect Operand Stack Depth**:    - Define a `block` that consumes more operands than available on the stack prior to the block. This checks if the implementation correctly manages stack height requirements.    - Constraint: Operand stack behavior.    - CFG Impact: Inconsistent CFG due to stack underflow, causing execution paths to misalign.
