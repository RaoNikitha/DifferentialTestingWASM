;; 5. **Test Description**: Create a block with depth `N`, containing multiple nested blocks. Include `br_if` in the innermost block with condition evaluation dependent on outer block results.    - **Constraint Checked**: Examines deep nesting and correct propagation of conditions from outer blocks.    - **Relation to Condition Evaluation**: Faulty depth handling or condition evaluation could lead to incorrect branch outcomes.
