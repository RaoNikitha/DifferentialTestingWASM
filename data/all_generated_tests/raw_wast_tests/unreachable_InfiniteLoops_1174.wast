;; 5. **Test Description:**    - Implement a `loop` where `unreachable` is placed after a series of valid arithmetic operations but before a `br_if` that should exit the loop. The arithmetic operations must not run infinitely.    - Constraint: Validates that the `unreachable` instruction within complex instruction sequences properly causes an immediate trap.    - Infinite Loop Relation: Prevents the loop from running indefinitely by confirming `unreachable` traps.
