;; 10. **Test Description:**    Create a `br_if` instruction within a `loop` that evaluates a condition based on both local and imported variables. Ensure the branch only executes when the combined condition is true.    - **Constraint Checked:** Branching based on conditions involving both local and imported variables within loops.    - **Relation to Incorrect Condition Evaluation:** Confirms correct branching based on complex conditions involving multiple variable scopes.
