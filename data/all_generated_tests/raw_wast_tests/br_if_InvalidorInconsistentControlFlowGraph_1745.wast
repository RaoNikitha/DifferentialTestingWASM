;; 6. **Test Description: Mixed Loops and Conditional Structures**    - Construct nested `loop` and `if` statements with `br_if` instructions to conditionally continue or break, leading to potentially undefinable states.    - **Constraint Check**: Validate that control flow results in valid states regardless of branches taken.    - **CFG Relevance**: Ensures conditional jumps in mixed control structures respect CFG coherence.
