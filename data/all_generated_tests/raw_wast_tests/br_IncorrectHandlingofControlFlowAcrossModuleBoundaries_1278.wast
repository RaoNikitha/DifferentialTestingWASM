;; 9. **Br within Nested Loops and Imported Function:**    - Create nested loops within module A, employing `br` instructions for looping controls that involve calling functions imported from module B. This tests if the operand stack and the loop control flow remain consistent when transitioning across module calls.    - **Constraint Checked:** Loop controls and stack unwinding correctness during cross-module transitions.    - **Relation to Constraint:** Validates the integrity of nested loop structures and stack during cross-module transitional instructions.
