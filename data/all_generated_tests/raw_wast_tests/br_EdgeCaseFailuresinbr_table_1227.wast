;; 8. **Dynamic Index Generation:**    - Description: The index for the `br_table` is computed dynamically within the code (e.g., based on a function's result).    - Evaluate the implementationâ€™s ability to handle dynamically computed indices and ensure the branch targets are correctly processed.    - Specific Constraint: Ensure dynamic index generation leads to correct execution paths without misinterpretation.
