;; 10. **Test Description:**     - **Test Name:** Combined Branch in Import and Export Test     - **Objective:** Validate branching behaviors when both import and export function calls are involved, with `br` instructions used.     - **Constraint:** Checks if control flow instructions handle transitions between imported and exported functions without corrupting the stack.     - **Relation to Incorrect Handling:** Ensures proper execution and control flow integrity when branching occurs between multiple function calls across module boundaries.
