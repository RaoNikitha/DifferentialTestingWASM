;; 7. **Block Type Misinterpretation Causing Execution to Unreachable**:    - Produce a `block` with a declared `blocktype` that mismatches actual operand types. Execute instructions that violate stack behavior, ultimately leading to the `unreachable` instruction due to incorrect context-induced types.
