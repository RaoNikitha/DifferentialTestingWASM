;; 9. **Test 9: Exception Handling with Nested Blocks and Branches**    - **Description:** Nested blocks containing `throw` instructions and corresponding `catch` blocks, with `br` instructions within them.    - **Constraint:** Verifies correct interaction of exception handling and nested block control flow.    - **Mismanagement Check:** Validates the proper handling of control flow when exceptions occur within nested structures and the branching out of exceptions.
