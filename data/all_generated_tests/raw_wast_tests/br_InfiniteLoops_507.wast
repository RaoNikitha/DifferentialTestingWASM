;; 8. **Test Description:**    - Create a scenario where a loop with a `br` instruction is misconfigured to loop back to the same label without proper operand stack handling.    - **Constraint Checking:** Validates if the `br` implementation handles operand stack management when branching back to a loop start.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops:** Improper operand stack handling can cause the loop to continuously restart without reaching an exit condition.
