;; 3. **Test Description:**    - Use an `if` control construct containing a nested `block` and a `br` instruction targeting the `block`.    - **Constraint:** Ensure that execution resumes after the `block`â€™s end when the branch is taken.    - **CFG Check:** Verifies the proper handling of forward branches and avoids CFG misinterpretation of block boundaries.
