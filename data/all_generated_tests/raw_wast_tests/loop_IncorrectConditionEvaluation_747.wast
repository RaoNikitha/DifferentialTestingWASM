;; 8. **Test Description**: Combine logical negation with a `br_if` within a loop, e.g., `br_if` when a flag is `not false`. Verify the negation is correctly handled, and branching decisions follow suit.    - **Constraint**: Ensure that logical negation correctly influences the loop's `br_if` branching decisions.    - **Incorrect Condition Evaluation**: Incorrect evaluations due to logical negation errors are tested.
