;; 1. **Test for Call Alignment with Incorrect Operand Stack:**    A test where a `call` instruction is executed followed by a `br` that mismanages the operand stack, resulting in incorrect alignment for the subsequent function call. Verify if the `br` instruction correctly aligns the operand stack for the function call.
