;; 8. **Test Description**: In a `br_table` with targets, provide an index exactly at the limit of valid range and one slightly beyond to check both boundary and off-by-one error handling.    - **Specific Constraint**: Boundary conditions and off-by-one errors in index handling.    - **Relation to `call`**: Similar boundary checking is crucial for `call` index validity.
