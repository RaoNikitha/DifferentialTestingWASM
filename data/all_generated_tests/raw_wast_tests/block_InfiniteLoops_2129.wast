;; 10. **Faulty Control Flow with `br_if`**:    - **Test Description**: Create a loop where a `br_if` inside a nested block is mishandled, either by incorrect evaluation or misdirected control flow, leading to an infinite loop.    - **Constraint**: Ensuring `br_if` instructions are authenticated correctly according to nested blocks.    - **Relation to Infinite Loops**: Faulty control flow in evaluating `br_if` can keep looping indefinitely.
