;; 9. **Test Description**: Nest a loop and an `if` inside another loop, with a `br_if` targeting the outermost loop from inside the `if`. Test for correct backward jump and loop re-entry.    - **Constraint Checked**: Correctly maintaining loop re-entry point through conditional branching.    - **Relation to Mismanagement of Block Nesting**: Errors can cause failed or incorrect loop restart handling.
