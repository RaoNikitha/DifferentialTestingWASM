;; 4. **Test Name: Nested Infinite Loops**    - **Description**: Create nested loops where the inner loop always branches back to itself, causing the outer loop to never complete its first iteration.    - **Constraint Checked**: Nested loop handling and correct validation of multiple levels of loop re-evaluation.    - **Infinite Loop Relation**: Continuous execution of the inner loop prevents exiting.
