;; 3. **Recursive Function with Mismatched Stack Operations**:    - **Description**: Create a recursive function where each call doesn't properly manage the stack (pushing more values than popping, or vice versa) leading to an imbalance.    - **Reason**: This tests proper handling of stack operations and type checks within recursive calls. Incorrect handling can lead to conditions perpetuating an infinite loop.
