;; 7. **Test Description**:     - Formulate a structure where `br_if` targets a label within itself but crosses the loop boundary improperly.    - **Constraint Checking**: Tests the label target validation and proper consideration of loop entries while exiting.    - **Infinite Loop Relation**: Ensures that improper label crossing doesn't cause the loop to continue indefinitely, confirming valid target resolution in `wizard_engine`.
