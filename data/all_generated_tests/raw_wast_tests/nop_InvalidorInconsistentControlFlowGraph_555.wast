;; 6. **`nop` within Conditional Branches**:    - Deploy `nop` instructions between conditional `br_if` branches inside loops and blocks. Check if the CFG properly associates the conditions with the correct paths.    - Constraint: Ensures conditional branchesâ€™ CFG correctly bypasses `nop` in branches.
