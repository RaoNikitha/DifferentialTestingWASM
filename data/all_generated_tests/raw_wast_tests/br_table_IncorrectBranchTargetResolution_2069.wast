;; 9. **Test Description:** Create a loop with a `br_table` whose operand vectors include labels pointing both forward and backward, validating the resolution and correct execution of backward and forward branches.    - **Constraint Checked:** Validates bi-directional branching within loops.    - **Relation to Incorrect Branch Target Resolution:** Incorrect branch directions lead to improper loop execution.
