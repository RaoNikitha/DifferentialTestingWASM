;; 6. **Test 6**:    - Description: Design a loop that calls an exported function which runs another loop and calls back the original moduleâ€™s function.    - Specific Constraint: Both loops and cross-boundary function calls should maintain the stack correctly, especially after nested loop executions.    - Control Flow Relation: Verifies correct control flow and stack handling in nested loop scenarios involving cross-module calls.
