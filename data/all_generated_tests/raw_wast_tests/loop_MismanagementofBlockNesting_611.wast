;; 2. **Incorrect Block Type in Nested Loop**: Construct a loop with an incorrectly specified `blocktype` nested inside another loop. Observe how the implementation validates the nested loopâ€™s `blocktype` against the specified constraints in the extended context. The differential error handling can reveal discrepancies in block type validation.
