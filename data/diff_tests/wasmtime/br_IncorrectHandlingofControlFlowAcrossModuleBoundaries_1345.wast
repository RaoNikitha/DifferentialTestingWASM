;; 6. **Test Description:** Create a test where an imported function is called, containing a `loop` with a `br` instruction targeting the loop. Validate if the backward jump remains within expected stack constraints.    - **Constraint:** Validates the correct handling of backward branches within loops on imported functions.    - **Relation:** Examines whether backward branch targeting in loops is handled correctly across module boundaries.
