;; 2. **Conditional Branch to Loop with Imported Function**:    - **Description**: A WebAssembly module (A) contains a `br_if` instruction within a loop that conditionally calls an imported function from module B. Verify correct stack unwinding and type consistency upon returning from the imported function based on the branch condition.    - **Constraint**: Ensure conditional branch correctly targets the loop and the imported function manages stack transitions accurately.
