;; 7. **Test Description:** Design a function to use `br` to branch out to a label defined before a series of nested `loops`, with the branch causing an immediate call to an imported module function engaging more control instructions.    **Specific Constraint:** Tests consistency of backward branches and loop structure handling right before calling inter-module functions.    **Relation to Control Flow Boundaries:** Ensures that backward jumps and subsequent function calls do not lead to stack corruption.
