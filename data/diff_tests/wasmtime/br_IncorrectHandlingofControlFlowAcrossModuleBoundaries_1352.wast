;; 3. **Test Description:**    - **Test Name:** Nested Import Function Branch Test    - **Objective:** Check if the `br` instruction correctly manages branches within deeply nested structures involving imported functions.    - **Constraint:** Verifies correct label indexing and operand stack management with nested imports.    - **Relation to Incorrect Handling:** Ensures robustness in handling complex nested control flows across module boundaries.
