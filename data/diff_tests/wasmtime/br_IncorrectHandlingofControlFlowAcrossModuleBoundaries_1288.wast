;; 9. **Test Description:** Create a WASM function that uses `br` multiple times within various nested `block` and `if` structures and after each `br`, calls a function imported from another module.    **Specific Constraint:** This ensures correct control flow and operand stack status recovery after each branch.    **Relation to Control Flow Boundaries:** Ensures robust handling of nested `br` transitions across module calls, verifying stack consistency.
