;; 5. **Default Branch to Exported Function Following Index Calculation**:    - Test Description: Design a `br_table` instruction where the operand for the index is calculated dynamically and branches to a default target exported from another module, ensuring correct control flow and operand stack handling.    - Constraint: Tests correct index calculation and default target branching involving exports, ensuring appropriate stack unwinding and re-entry.    - Differential Reasoning: Irregularities in index calculation or stack unwinding during default labeling might reveal inconsistencies in `wizard_engine`.
