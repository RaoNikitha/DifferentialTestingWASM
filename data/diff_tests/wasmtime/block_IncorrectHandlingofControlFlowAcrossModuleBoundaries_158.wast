;; 9. **Block with Loop and Import/Export Interaction**:    - Develop a function that includes a `block` with a loop that interacts with imported and exported functions. Ensure the loop contains both backward (`br`) and forward (`br_if`) branches. The test confirms that both implementations accurately maintain control flow and stack states throughout the loop.
