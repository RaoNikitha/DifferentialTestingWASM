;; 8. **Testing Cross-Module Invocation Sequences with `nop`**:    - **Constraint Checked**: Verifies integrity of instruction sequences involving multiple module calls.    - **Description**: Define a complex function in the main module that makes calls to several imported functions sequentially, using `nop` instructions before and after each call. Validate consistency in execution flow between the two implementations.
