;; 9. **Test Imports/Exports with Large Operand Stack**:    - Description: Import and export functions that manipulate a large operand stack (e.g., by pushing many values). Verify that returns correctly handle large amounts of data on the stack.    - Constraint: Ensure the correct handling of the operand stack's size and content as it crosses module boundaries.
