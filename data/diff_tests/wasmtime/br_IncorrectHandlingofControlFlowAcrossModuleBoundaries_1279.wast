;; 10. **Branching in Module A Influencing Calls in Imported Module B:**     - Integrate module A where branching decisions and control flow variations (using `br`) impact the calling of multiple functions imported from module B. This setup tests if stack integrity and proper control flow are maintained when cross-module calls are influenced by branching.     - **Constraint Checked:** Proper control flow and stack integrity when branching instructions influence cross-module calls.     - **Relation to Constraint:** Ensures branching and control flow maintain operand stack and consistency during transitions driven by modular function calls.
