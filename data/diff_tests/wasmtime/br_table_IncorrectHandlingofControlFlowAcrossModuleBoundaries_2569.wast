;; 8. **Control Flow Loop with Imported Functions:**    - Implement a loop with `br_table` branching to an imported function within one of its target labels.    - **Constraint Checked:** Verification of loop consistency, control flow, and operand stack integrity within `br_table` when involving imported functions.    - **Reasoning:** Checks that the control flow loop correctly unwinds and maintains integrity during cross-module calls.
