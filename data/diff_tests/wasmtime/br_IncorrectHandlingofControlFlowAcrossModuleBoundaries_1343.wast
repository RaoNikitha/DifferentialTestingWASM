;; 4. **Test Description:** Implement a scenario where an imported function contains a `br` instruction with missing operands on the stack, leading to an error. Verify if the error is correctly detected and reported.    - **Constraint:** Tests the requirement for correct operand handling and error detection in branched instructions.    - **Relation:** Ensures that operand stack preservation rules are enforced when transitioning through module boundaries.
