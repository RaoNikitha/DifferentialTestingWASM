;; 10. **Test Description**: Design a `_call` to internal imported functions which results in a `br_table` with conditionally varied indices. Monitor for consistent index-based control transitions in both engines, especially under constrained imports.    - **Reasoning**: Validates handling of import resolution within `call` and its effect on `br_table` execution consistency, focusing on index boundaries within constraints.  These test descriptions are designed to uncover subtle differences particularly focusing on how edge cases in the `br_table` instruction are handled post `call` invocations in varied implementations, ensuring type, index, and contextual violations are captured differentially.
