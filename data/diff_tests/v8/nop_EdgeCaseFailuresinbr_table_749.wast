;; 10. **Test Description**: Place `nop` directly after the function entry and immediately before `br_table` having several indices, some exceeding the count of valid label branches.    - **Constraint**: Ensuring that `nop`’s proximity to function start does not affect `br_table` index handling.    - **Edge Case**: Guarantees `br_table`’s correct behavior with out-of-bounds targets.
