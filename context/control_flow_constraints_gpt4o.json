{"instruction": ["nop", "unreachable", "block", "loop", "if", "br", "br_if", "br_table", "return", "call", "call_indirect"], "structure_constraints": ["When implementing the `nop` instruction from the WebAssembly 2.0 specification, there are several specific constraints and conditions to consider. Here are the key points relevant to the `nop` instruction, extracted from the provided documentation:\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - `nop` is defined in the `instr` grammar section: `instr ::= ... | nop ...`. This denotes that `nop` is one of the valid instructions within the instruction set.\n\n2. **Operation**:\n   - The `nop` instruction does nothing. This is explicitly mentioned: \"The `nop` instruction does nothing.\" \n   - It doesn't perform any computation, side-effects, or state modifications.\n   - The stack remains unchanged when a `nop` instruction is encountered.\n\n3. **Control Flow Impact**:\n   - `nop` does not affect the flow of control. This instruction will simply be skipped during execution, proceeding to the next instruction.\n   - Since it does nothing, it doesn't introduce or alter labels, branches, or control structures.\n\n4. **Stack Behavior**:\n   - `nop` does not consume or produce any values on the operand stack. The stack's state before and after a `nop` instruction remains identical.\n\n5. **Context and Placement**:\n   - `nop` can be validly placed within any well-formed sequence of instructions. Its presence should not affect the validation of surrounding control structures (like `block`, `loop`, `if`, etc.).\n   - It can be positioned within any part of a function but cannot be used as an operation that alters computational or control logic.\n\n6. **Labels and Branching**:\n   - Being a standalone instruction with no labels or branching capabilities, `nop` itself has no associated labels or targets for branch instructions.\n   - Its placement must ensure proper nesting and sequencing as per the structured control instructions' requirements.\n\n7. **Side-Effects and Traps**:\n   - `nop` does not produce any side effects or traps. It does not interact with the memory, tables, globals, or other environmental states.\n\n8. **Validation**:\n   - During module validation, the presence of `nop` should not trigger any errors or warnings, assuming all other parts of the function and control flow are valid.\n   - Any misinterpretation leading to `nop` attempting to interact with the stack, control flow, or state should be flagged.\n\n9. **Compatibility**:\n   - `nop` must be recognized and properly handled by all WebAssembly-compliant execution environments as per the specification.\n   - Any environment incorrectly handling `nop` (e.g., producing outputs or altering execution flow) should be identified through differential testing.\n\nThe implementation of `nop` should strictly comply with the points above. Misinterpretations or missed nuances, such as altering the stack state or control flow, producing a side effect, or being incorrectly invalidated, form essential aspects for rigorous differential testing.", "From the given document, we can extract the following key points relevant to the implementation of the `unreachable` instruction in WebAssembly. These constraints and conditions must be strictly followed to ensure the correct behavior of the `unreachable` instruction and to identify potential misinterpretations for differential testing:\n\n1. **Purpose of `unreachable`:**\n   - The `unreachable` instruction causes an unconditional trap.\n\n2. **Behavioral Constraints:**\n   - When the `unreachable` instruction is executed, it must cause an immediate and unconditional trap, meaning that no further instructions are executed after it.\n   - This trap should behave the same across different WebAssembly environments, implying that the behavior of `unreachable` is deterministic and consistent.\n\n3. **Control Flow Impact:**\n   - The `unreachable` instruction affects the flow of control by causing a trap, thereby interrupting the normal execution path.\n\n4. **Interaction with the Operand Stack:**\n   - The `unreachable` instruction does not have any direct interaction with the operand stack (i.e., it does not consume or produce any values on the stack).\n\n5. **Contextual Placement:**\n   - The `unreachable` instruction can be placed anywhere within a function body, including within blocks, loops, or conditionals.\n   - Regardless of its placement, the execution of `unreachable` must always lead to a trap, interrupting any surrounding control structures.\n\n6. **Error Handling and Traps:**\n   - The trap caused by `unreachable` must be handled according to the WebAssembly environment's error handling mechanisms.\n   - This implies that the behavior when catching or reporting the trap should be consistent across implementations.\n\nThese specific details must be implemented and observed to ensure the correct and expected behavior of the `unreachable` instruction in WebAssembly, and they provide a basis for generating differential tests to identify discrepancies across different environments.", "To extract key points relevant to the `block` instruction for generating differential tests, let's identify the specific constraints and conditions from the document provided. \n\n### Key Points Relevant to the `block` Instruction\n\n1. **General Structure**:\n   - The `block` instruction has the format: `block blocktype instr* end`.\n\n2. **Block Type**:\n   - `blocktype` can be either a `typeidx` (an index pointing to a function type) or `valtype?` (an optional value type).\n   - When given as an optional value type (`valtype?`), it is shorthand for the function type `[] !

These operands are consumed and pushed back onto the operand stack after unwinding.\n\n7. **Branch Instructions Interacting with `loop`**:\n   - **br**: Unconditional branch to the target loop.\n   - **br\\_if**: Conditional branch to the target loop.\n   - **br\\_table**: Indirect branch through an operand indexing into a label vector, or to a default target if the operand is out of bounds.\n\n8. **Side Effects**:\n   - The `loop` instruction, when branched to, reinitializes its block, meaning execution starts anew at the beginning of the loop block.\n\n### Constraints and Conditions Specific to `loop`:\n\n1. **Syntax Compliance**:\n   - Ensure the `loop` instruction strictly follows the `loop blocktype instr* end` syntax.\n   \n2. **Block Type Specification**:\n   - Ensure `blocktype` is correctly specified either as a `typeidx` referring to a function type or as an optional `valtype?`.\n\n3. **Well-Nested Structure**:\n   - Ensure the `loop` block and its nested instructions are well-nested and properly terminated by an `end`.\n\n4. **Label Indexing**:\n   - Verify correct handling of implicit label indices, ensuring branches correctly refer to the innermost enclosing loop or other nested blocks.\n\n5. **Branching Logic**:\n   - Test the correct implementation of backward jumps for branches targeting a `loop`. Ensure it behaves as a `continue` in C-like languages.\n   - Ensure `br`, `br_if`, and `br_table` instructions correctly branch to the target `loop`.\n\n6. **Stack Unwinding**:\n   - Ensure operand stack unwinding correctly up to the height where the loop was entered.\n   - Verify backward branches consume proper operands according to the loop block's input type and push them back onto the stack after unwinding.\n\n7. **Indirect Branch Handling**:\n   - Ensure the `br_table` instruction handles indirect branches correctly, including default targets when the operand is out of bounds.\n\n8. **Execution Reinitialization**:\n   - Verify that branching to a `loop` correctly reinitializes and restarts execution from the beginning of the loop block.\n\nBy closely following these constraints and conditions, differential tests can be designed to check for discrepancies and misinterpretations in different WebAssembly implementations.", "When implementing the `if` instruction in a WebAssembly framework, the following key points, constraints, and conditions must be strictly followed:\n\n1. **Syntax and Structure**:\n   - The `if` instruction is of the form:\n     ```wasm\n     if blocktype instr* else instr* end\n     ```\n   - It starts with the keyword `if`, followed by an optional `blocktype`, then a series of nested instructions (`instr*`), an optional `else` keyword followed by another series of instructions (`instr*`), and finally terminated by the `end` pseudo-instruction.\n\n2. **Blocktype**:\n   - The `blocktype` specifies the input and output types for the block.\n   - It is either a `typeidx` referring to a function type in the type section or an optional `valtype` with the shorthand `[] -> [valtype?]`.\n   - This blocktype defines what types the input and output stacks should handle.\n\n3. **Nesting and Labeling**:\n   - Each `if` instruction introduces an implicit label for branch instructions.\n   - Labels are indexed relatively by nesting depth. Label `0` refers to the innermost enclosing structured control instruction, with higher indices referring to outer enclosures.\n   - This implies labels can only be referenced within their associated `if` block and branches can only break outwards.\n\n4. **Control Flow**:\n   - The `else` part of the `if` instruction is optional.\n   - The flow must maintain structured control, which ensures branches targeting the `if` block act like break statements.\n   - Upon an `if` condition evaluation, if true, the instructions following the `if` keyword are executed up to the `else` or `end`. If false, control jumps to the instructions after the `else` keyword or directly to the `end` if `else` is absent.\n\n5. **Stack Management**:\n   - The operand stack must be managed according to the block type's input and output specifications.\n   - Forward branches from the `if` block are required to match the operand stack height and types with the blocktype\u2019s output specification.\n   - Upon taking a branch, the operand stack up to the height at block entry is unwound, and the branch may consume additional operands to match the output stack height.\n\n6. **Instructions Semantics**:\n   - The `if` condition is evaluated based on the top of the operand stack.\n   - If true (`non-zero` value), the instructions following the `if` are executed.\n   - If false (`zero` value), execution bypasses to the `else` part if it exists, or to `end`.\n\n7. **Error Handling and Traps**:\n   - The `unreachable` instruction within an `if` block causes an unconditional trap.\n   - Proper error handling ensures instructions in both `if` and `else` branches are valid and the operand stack requirements are consistent with the blocktype.\n\n8. **Constraints for Well-Nested Blocks**:\n   - `if` blocks must be well-nested within other structured control instructions such as `block`, `loop`, or another `if`.\n   - Improper nesting or mismatched `end` instructions lead to validation errors.\n\nBy adhering to these precise constraints and conditions for implementing the `if` instruction, differential tests can identify variances in different WebAssembly implementations, especially where nuances or strict interpretations might be missed.", "The `br` instruction in WebAssembly is a control instruction that performs an unconditional branch to a label.

Misinterpreting relative label indices in nested structures.\n2. Incorrect management or restoration of operand stack after unwinding.\n3. Violating structured control flow by improperly targeting labels.\n4. Incorrect handling of forward vs. backward branches, especially with respect to the operand stack.\n5. Ensuring the target of a branch conforms to the type requirements of the block\u2019s input or output.\n\nThese specific points and constraints can be used to create differential tests to ensure different implementations adhere strictly to these behavior rules and do not misinterpret any nuances in the specification regarding the `br` instruction.", "To ensure precision and comprehensiveness when implementing and testing the `br_if` instruction, let's extract and elaborate on the key points and constraints detailed in the provided section of the WebAssembly 2.0 specification document. Here's what you need to focus on:\n\n### br_if Instruction Constraints and Conditions\n\n1. **General Description**:\n   - The `br_if` instruction performs a conditional branch.\n\n2. **Label References**:\n   - Labels are referenced by indices that are relative to the nesting depth:\n     - **Label `0`**: Refers to the innermost structured control instruction enclosing the `br_if`.\n     - **Increasing Indices**: Refer to structured control instructions that are progressively farther out.\n\n3. **Execution Context**:\n   - The structured control instructions (`block`, `loop`, and `if`) must be well-nested.\n   - Branching via labels can only target enclosing structured control instructions.\n   - A branch targeting `block` or `if` is a forward jump (similar to a C-like `break` statement).\n   - A branch targeting `loop` is a backward jump to the beginning of the loop (similar to a C-like `continue` statement).\n\n4. **Operand Stack**:\n   - When taking a branch, the operand stack is unwound to the height at which the targeted structured control instruction was entered.\n   - Branches may consume additional operands, pushing them on the operand stack after unwinding.\n   - Forward branches require operands according to the output type of the targeted block (values representing the terminated block's output).\n   - Backward branches (targeting loops) require operands according to the input type of the targeted block (values consumed by the loop).\n\n5. **Specific `br_if` Operation**:\n   - The `br_if` instruction performs a conditional check on an operand from the stack (typically the top of the stack).\n   - If the condition (operand value) is true (non-zero), the branch is taken.\n   - If the condition is false (zero), the branch is not taken and execution continues with the next instruction.\n  \n6. **Handling Edge Cases**:\n   - The index operand for `br_if` must be within bounds, referring to a valid target nested block.\n   - Although all branch instructions, including `br_if`, cause unwinding of the operand stack, they maintain specific stack requirements based on the position they branch to, adhering to the input/output type of the target block.\n  \nBy understanding and implementing these rules precisely, differential tests can be created to examine different WebAssembly implementations. These tests will ensure each implementation adheres strictly to the spec, catching subtle bugs or misinterpretations.", "### Key Points on `br_table` Instruction from the WebAssembly Specification Document\n\nThe `br_table` instruction is a type of branch instruction that performs an indirect branch through an operand by indexing into a label vector provided as an immediate to the instruction. Here are the extremely specific constraints and conditions detailed in the specification:\n\n1. **Operand and Indexing:**\n   - The `br_table` instruction takes an operand from the stack.\n   - This operand is used to index into a vector of label indices.\n   - If the operand is out of bounds (i.e., it does not correspond to any label index within the provided vector), the instruction instead branches to a default target label index which is provided as part of the immediate.\n\n2. **Immediate Parameters:**\n   - The immediate for `br_table` consists of two parts: a vector of label indices (`vec(labelidx)`) and a default label index (`labelidx`).\n   - The length of the label vector and its indices must be correctly encoded.\n\n3. **Stack Management:**\n   - The branch instruction unwinds the operand stack to the point where the targeted structured control instruction was entered.\n   - It may consume operands and push them back on the operand stack after unwinding.\n   \n4. **Forward and Backward Branches:**\n   - Forward branches require operands matching the output of the targeted block\u2019s type, representing values produced by the terminated block.\n   - Backward branches require operands matching the input of the targeted block\u2019s type, representing values consumed by the restarted block.\n\n5. **Control Flow Constraints:**\n   - Branch instructions can only direct branches outwards, breaking from the block of the control construct they target.\n   - `br_table` must follow the structured control flow rules, meaning branches can only exit from or loop back within well-nested structured control instructions (`block`, `loop`, `if`).\n   \n6. **Operand and Target Matching:**\n   - The type of operands required by the branch operation must match the operand stack configuration expected by the target block.\n\n7. **Label Indexing:**\n   - Label indices in `br_table` are relative to the current block's nesting depth.\n   - Label 0 refers to the innermost block enclosing the `br_table` instruction. \n\n8. **Potential Traps:**\n   - If the operand for `br_table` is out of bounds, the default label index is used.\n   - Improper targeting or incorrect operand matching can lead to traps if they do not align with the expected stack configurations or block types.\n\n### Potential Misinterpreted Details:\n\n1. **Relative Label Indices:**\n   - Misinterpreting how relative indexing works, especially with nested blocks, could lead to incorrect branching targets.\n\n2. **Operand Stack Management:**\n   - Incorrect unwinding or operand stack handling when the branch is taken could lead to incorrect state resulting in unexpected behavior or crashes.\n\n3. **Immediate Encoding:**\n   - Misencoding the immediate part of the instruction, either the vector of label indices or the default target.\n\n4. **Type Matching:**\n   - Ensuring that the operands match the type requirements of the targeted block, both for forward and backward branches.\n\n5. **Control Flow Rules:**\n   - Misunderstanding or ignoring control flow rules, such as branches only being able to exit outer blocks and not jumping into deeper inner blocks.\n\nBy adhering to these extracted constraints and conditions, differential tests can be designed to thoroughly validate implementations of the `br_table` instruction against potential misinterpretations and subtle specification nuances.", "Sure, here are the key points relevant to the `return` instruction extracted from the documentation, with specific constraints and conditions summarized:\n\n### Key Points and Constraints for the `return` Instruction in WebAssembly\n\n1. **Unconditional Branch to Outermost Block**:\n   - The `return` instruction acts as an unconditional branch to the outermost block. This block is implicitly the body of the current function.\n\n2. **Operand Stack Unwinding**:\n   - When the `return` instruction is called, it unwinds the operand stack up to the height where the outermost block was entered. This means it discards any intermediate values on the stack that were added after entering this block.\n\n3. **Handling of Operands**:\n   - Though the `return` instruction unwinds the stack, it may also need to handle additional operands. These operands can be consumed by the `return` instruction and then pushed back onto the stack after unwinding to match the output values required by the outermost block's type.\n\n4. **Forward Branch Requirement**:\n   - The forward branch behavior of the `return` instruction mandates that the operands it manages must comply with the output type of the outermost block. Since there are no backward branches relevant to `return`, it only considers the values to be produced by the block it terminates.\n\n5. **Implicit Behavior**:\n   - The implicit nature of the `return` instruction targeting the outermost block needs to be rigorously adhered to. An incorrect implementation might target an intermediate block mistakenly.\n\nThese points summarize the critical constraints and behaviors for the `return` instruction, ensuring that implementations can be accurately tested for compliance with the specification. Misinterpretations could arise from incorrect stack unwinding, operand handling, or misidentifying the target block, so differential tests can be crafted around these nuances to verify the adherence of WASM implementations to the spec.", "Certainly!

Always validate indices.\n\n- **Return Values**:\n    - Properly handling multiple return values and ensuring they are pushed back in the correct order is crucial.\n    - Avoid off-by-one errors when manipulating the stack for function results.\n\n- **Stack Unwinding**:\n    - Pay attention to how arguments are consumed from the stack and how results are placed back, particularly when dealing with nested calls and stack height adjustments.\n\n- **Error and Trap Handling**:\n    - Different environments might handle traps or errors differently. Ensuring a consistent protocol for handling erroneous situations is essential.\n\nArmed with these detailed points, you can create differential tests that verify whether different implementations of the WebAssembly `call` instruction adhere strictly to the specification.

If the index is out of bounds, it should result in an error or a trap.\n\n6. **Function Type Conformity**:\n   - The callee function type in the table must conform to the expected function type indexed by `typeidx`.\n   - Types must match exactly according to the function signature, including the number and types of parameters and return values.\n\n7. **Trap Conditions**:\n   - If there is a type mismatch between the function in the table and the expected function type, a trap occurs.\n   - If the table index is out of bounds or invalid, a trap occurs.\n\n8. **Operand Handling**:\n   - When the `call_indirect` instruction is executed, it requires sufficient operands on the stack according to the function signature.\n   - Lack of required operands or any operand stack underflow will result in failure or a trap.\n\n9. **Type Indexing**:\n   - The `typeidx` refers to the function type defined within the module.\n   - The function type must be predefined and valid within the context of the WebAssembly module's type section.\n\n10. **Miscellaneous Points**:\n    - A `call_indirect` instruction must specify a table index (`tableidx`) and a type index (`typeidx`).\n    - The table must be a valid table reference, already defined in the module\u2019s table section.\n    - Only tables of type `funcref` are suitable for `call_indirect`.\n\n### Additional Considerations for Differential Testing:\n\n- Ensure that function types are correctly defined and referenced.\n- Verify proper trapping behavior when there is a type mismatch during dynamic function resolution.\n- Validate the proper handling of operand stack according to function signature requirements and conformity.\n- Ensure boundary checks for table indexing are robustly handled.\n- Verify correct table index and type index references, ensuring they exist and are valid.\n- Confirm that the WebAssembly module implements proper traps and error handling as specified when constraints are violated. \n\nThese extracted points will ensure thorough and specific differential tests are generated to find discrepancies in various WebAssembly implementations."], "validation_constraints": ["To ensure comprehensive testing and validation of the `nop` (no operation) instruction in WebAssembly, the following key points and constraints relevant to the `nop` instruction have been extracted from the WebAssembly specification document:\n\n1. **Basic Validation of `nop`**:\n   - The `nop` instruction is valid with the stack type `[] !

[]*.\"\n\n2. **Context Assumptions for `nop`**:\n   - The context in which the `nop` instruction is validated implicitly assumes an empty context with no pre-existing stack types since `[] ! []` denotes no input or output values.\n   - **Reference**:\n     - \"3.1.2 Prose Notation\" - \"*The rules implicitly assume a given context C*\" (Page 26).\n\n3. **General Validity Conditions**:\n   - Since `nop` is a control instruction and does not modify the stack, it must adhere to the general constraints specified for control instructions.\n   - **Reference**:\n     - \"3.3.8 Control Instructions\" - General (Page 43).\n\n4. **No Stack Polymorphism**:\n   - Unlike some other control instructions such as `unreachable`, the `nop` instruction is not stack-polymorphic, which means its type signature `[] ! []` is rigid and does not allow for any operand or result type flexibility.\n   - **Reference**:\n     - \"3.3. Instructions\" - \"Stack-polymorphic instructions\" (Page 31).\n\n5. **No Modifications to the Context**:\n   - The `nop` instruction does not alter any part of the validation context; it does not change the type of the operand stack, labels, functions, tables, memories, globals, element segments, or data segments.\n   - **Reference**:\n     - \"3.1.1 Contexts\" - General definition of context (Page 25).\n\n6. **Instruction Sequences**:\n   - When placed within an instruction sequence, the `nop` instruction does not change the type that corresponds to the state of the stack before and after the `nop` instruction.\n   - **Reference**:\n     - \"3.3.9 Instruction Sequences\" - (Page 46):\n       - \"*Empty Instruction Sequence: The empty instruction sequence is valid with type [t*] ! [t*], for any sequence of operand types t*]*\".\n       - \"*Non-empty Instruction Sequence...*\".\n\n7. **Module Validation**:\n   - `nop` can be included within modules, functions, and nested within other control structures where validation of encompassing structures like loops, blocks, or if-statements needs to ensure the type signature `[] ! []` is maintained for `nop`.\n   - **Reference**:\n     - \"3.4 Modules\" - \"Modules are valid when all the components they contain are valid\" (Page 48).\n\nThese constraints and conditions collectively define the valid use of the `nop` instruction in WebAssembly and must be adhered to in all compliant implementations. By constructing differential tests around these specific extracts, we ensure thorough validation against misinterpretations and nuances that may arise in various implementations.", "Based on the provided documentation, here are the key points and constraints relevant to the `unreachable` instruction in WebAssembly:\n\n1. **General Validity:**\n   - The `unreachable` instruction is valid with a stack type `[t*1] -> [t*2]` for any possible sequences of operand types `t*1` (input stack) and `t*2` (output stack).\n   - The rule ensuring this is: \\\n     `C \u22a2 unreachable : [t*1] -> [t*2]`\n\n2. **Polymorphism:**\n   - The `unreachable` instruction is classified as **stack-polymorphic**. This means it can have any stack type since it does not impose any constraints on the types of values on the stack.\n   - Given its stack-polymorphism, the following rule applies: \\\n     `C \u22a2 unreachable : [t*1] -> [t*2]`\n   - For example, it can assume the type `[] -> [i32 i32]` or any other sequence of operand types.\n\n3. **Type Matching in Instruction Sequences:**\n   - In sequences, the type of `unreachable` needs to match the expected stack types in the context of preceding or following instructions. Even though `unreachable` itself is stack-polymorphic, mismatches can occur when unsupported sequences are formed with other instructions.\n   - For instance, while `unreachable` itself can have sequence neutral types, incorrect sequence combinations can invalidate the instruction:\n     - Valid: `unreachable i32.add`, can assume type `[] -> [i32 i32]`.\n     - Invalid: `unreachable (i64.const 0) i32.add`, no type pick would make the sequence well-typed.\n\n4. **Usage Contexts:**\n   - The `unreachable` instruction can be used within any context where an instruction sequence is valid, even nested within other control instructions such as `block`, `loop`, or `if`. This is because of its stack-polymorphic nature.\n   - The rules are consistent in any context: \\\n     ``` \n     C \u22a2 instr sequence : stack type\n     C \u22a2 C' instr : [t*1] -> [t*2]\n     ```\n   - Slight deviations in stack types caused by `unreachable` should be accounted for to ensure every sequence remains valid under the inferred types.\n\n5. **Differential Testing Considerations:**\n   - Due to its stack-polymorphism, `unreachable` can be used deliberately to introduce checks in differential testing for validating interpreter or compilers' type-inference algorithms.\n   - Since the `unreachable` instruction\u2019s assumed types are only constrained by surrounding code, different WASM implementations might misinterpret these surrounding context types, exposing issues during differential testing.\n\nBy carefully considering these points and constraints, testers can design differential tests that accurately probe the precise adherence to specifications in various WebAssembly implementations. This helps catch subtle differences in how `unreachable` instructions are processed, particularly in instructions sequences where its polymorphism interacts with other type-constrained instructions.", "### Key Points Relevant to the `block` Instruction from the WASM 2.0 Specification:\n\n1. **Block Instruction Definition**:\n   - The `block` instruction is used to define a block of code with a label for structured control flow.\n   - The general form of the `block` instruction is:\n     ```\n     block blocktype instr* end\n     ```\n\n2. **Block Type Validation**:\n   - The `blocktype` must be a valid function type `[t*1] -> [t*2]`.\n     ```\n     C ` blocktype : [t*1] ! [t*2]\n     ```\n\n3. **Context Extension**:\n   - The context `C` is extended to `C0` to include the result type `[t*2]` in the labels vector:\n     ```\n     C0 = C, labels [t*2]\n     ```\n   - The notation `C, labels [t*]` inserts the new label type at index 0, shifting all existing labels.\n\n4. **Instruction Sequence Validation**:\n   - Under the extended context `C0`, the instruction sequence `instr*` must be valid with type `[t*1] -> [t*2]`:\n     ```\n     C, labels [t*2] ` instr* : [t*1] ! [t*2]\n     ```\n   - The entire `block` instruction is then valid with type `[t*1] -> [t*2]`:\n     ```\n     C ` block blocktype instr* end : [t*1] ! [t*2]\n     ```\n\n5. **Label Stack Management**:\n   - The block instruction introduces a new label with the corresponding result type, altering the label stack.\n   - The new label's insertion shifts the indices of existing labels.\n   - All labels are managed in a stack, enabling backward jumps.\n\n6. **Result Types Matching**:\n   - The instruction sequence inside the block must produce the same result type as specified by the `blocktype`.\n\n### Constraints and Conditions for Implementing the `block` Instruction:\n\n1. **Block Type Constraints**:\n   - The `blocktype` must be a function type and valid within the context.\n   - Ensure that the `blocktype` is consistently checked before processing the block.\n\n2. **Context Handling**:\n   - Extending the context must accurately add the result type of the block to the labels stack.\n   - Ensure proper handling of the label insertion and index shifts.\n\n3. **Instruction Sequence Validity**:\n   - Validate that the instruction sequence conforms to the type constraints induced by the block type within the extended context.\n   - Confirm that all instructions within the block collectively transition the operand stack from `[t*1]` to `[t*2]`.\n\n4. **Label Stack Manipulation**:\n   - Correctly handle the introduction and scope of the new label for the block.\n   - Accurate management of label indices, ensuring that jumps and labels are resolved correctly.\n\n5. **Result Type Compliance**:\n   - The instructions within the block must ensure that the final stack state matches the result type `[t*2]` describe by the block type.\n   - Any instruction within the block that potentially affects the stack must be scrutinized for type adherence.\n\nBy strictly adhering to these detailed constraints and conditions, differential tests can be devised to capture any deviations in implementation across different WASM environments. This will ensure that the block instruction behaves consistently and correctly according to the specification.", "### Key Points Relevant to the `loop` Instruction from the WebAssembly Specification\n\n#### 3.1 Conventions\n\n- **Validity Context**: \n  - \"Contexts are defined as records C with abstract syntax\":\n    ```plaintext\n    C ::= { types functype*, funcs functype*, tables tabletype*, mems memtype*, globals globaltype*, elems reftype*, datas ok*, locals valtype*, labels resulttype*, return resulttype?, refs funcidx* }\n    ```\n  - When spelling out a context, empty fields are omitted.\n  - `C, field A*` denotes the same context as C but with elements `A*` prepended to its field component sequence.\n\n#### 3.1.2 Prose Notation \n\n- Validity constraints and type classification depend on context `C`.\n\n#### 3.1.3 Formal Notation\n\n- Proposition: `A : T` is written as judgement `C \u22a2 A : T`.\n\n#### 3.2.2 Block Types\n\n- Types: block types are valid as function types once checked.\n\n#### 3.3.8 Control Instructions\n\n- **loop blocktype instr* end**:\n  - The block type must be valid as some function type `[t*1] -> [t*2]`.\n    - Judgement: `C \u22a2 blocktype : [t*1] -> [t*2]`.\n  - Let `C0` be the same context as `C`, but with the result type `[t*1]` prepended to the labels vector.\n    - Syntax: `C, labels [t*1]`.\n  - Under context `C0`, the instruction sequence `instr*` must be valid with type `[t*1] -> [t*2]`.\n    - Judgement: `C, labels [t*1] \u22a2 instr* : [t*1] -> [t*2]`.\n  - Then the compound instruction is valid with type `[t*1] -> [t*2]`.\n    - Judgement: `C \u22a2 loop blocktype instr* end : [t*1] -> [t*2]`.\n\n#### Detailed Constraints and Conditions\n\n1. **Block Type Validity**:\n    - Block type must conform as a valid function type `[t*1] to [t*2]`.\n      - If it is not conforming, the loop definition is invalid.\n\n2. **Context Extension**:\n    - The context `C` must be extended to `C0` with `labels [t*1]` for validation of the instruction sequence `instr*`.\n    - In the new context `C0`, the label stack is altered by prepending `[t*1]` to the labels vector.\n\n3. **Instruction Sequence Validity**:\n    - The sequence of instructions `instr*` must be validated under the extended context `C0`.\n    - The instruction sequence `instr*` must have the type `[t*1] to [t*2]`.\n\n4. **Label Type Insertion**:\n    - The label for the `loop` is introduced at the start of the label stack in the context `C0`. This changes the indexing of labels, which can be easily misinterpreted.\n\n5. **Context Prepending Mechanism**:\n    - Ensuring the new label type `[t*1]` is prepended correctly to avoid erroneous label references.\n\n6. **Matching Result Types**:\n    - Validation of result types: Must ensure that the instruction sequence within the `loop` conforms to the expected result types as specified by the block type.\n    \n7. **Consistency of Types**:\n    - Operand and result types must be consistent throughout the instruction sequence for the loop to be valid.\n\n8. **Extended Context Validation**:\n    - The context used to validate the instruction sequence (`C0`) is critical for proper validation; missing this step can result in differential behavior across implementations.\n\n#### Potential Misinterpretations\n\n1. **Incorrect Block Type Conversion**:\n    - Misinterpretation of converting block types to function types can result in invalid loops being instantiated.\n\n2. **Context Extension Errors**:\n    - If the context is not correctly extended to include the new label at the correct position, the validation process will fail, leading to invalid loops being passed or valid loops being rejected.\n\n3. **Label Index Errors**:\n    - Label indexing errors can easily occur if the labels are not handled or prepended correctly, affecting loop validation.\n\n4. **Instruction Sequence Validation Scope**:\n    - If the instruction sequence `instr*` is not validated under the extended context `C0`, inconsistencies in type handling will arise, causing differential outputs.\n\nBy strictly following these constraints and conditions, differential tests can be generated to compare the behavior of various implementations and ensure that they strictly adhere to the WebAssembly specification for loop instructions.", "To identify differential tests for the `if` instruction within WebAssembly implementations, you need to focus on extracting precise constraints and conditions from the specification that strictly define how the `if` instruction should be implemented. Here are the key points relevant to the `if` instruction as extracted from the official WebAssembly specification document:\n\n### Formal Notation for `if` Instruction Validation:\nThe structure and validation of the `if` instruction are detailed in section 3.3.8 Control Instructions.\n\n#### Rule Structure:\nThe validation of an `if` instruction follows a specific set of rules that must be strictly enforced to maintain the uniformity and correctness of WebAssembly modules across different environments.\n\n#### Constraints and Conditions:\n1. **Instruction Type Validation**:\n   - The `if` instruction is validated by defining a block type, which specifies the input and output types of the block.\n   - The block type of the `if` instruction must always be treated as some function type `[t* (input types)] -> [t* (output types)]`.\n\n2. **Context Extension in `if` Instruction**:\n   - An extended context `C'` (C0 in the document) must be used when validating the instruction sequences within the `then` and `else` blocks. The context `C'` includes the prepended result type `[t* (output types)]` to the existing labels vector. This context extension is denoted by:\n     ```\n     C, labels [t* (output types)]\n     ```\n\n3. **Validation of `then` and `else` Sequences**:\n   - Both the `then` and the `else` blocks must be validated under the extended context `C'`.\n   - Under context `C'`, the instruction sequence within the `then` block (`instr*1`) must be valid with type `[t* (input types)] -> [t* (output types)]`.\n   - Similarly, under context `C'`, the instruction sequence within the `else` block (`instr*2`) must be valid with type `[t* (input types)] -> [t* (output types)]`.\n\n4. **Input Type Constraints**:\n   - The `if` instruction requires an input of type `i32` on the stack for evaluation. Hence the combined stack input type for the `if` instruction is `[t* (input types) i32]`.\n\n5. **Result Type Matching**:\n   - The result type of the `then` and `else` blocks must exactly match the block type result type `[t* (output types)]`.\n\n6. **Compound Validation**:\n   - The entire `if` instruction is thus validated as a compound instruction having the stack type `[t* (input types) i32] -> [t* (output types)]`.\n\n#### Formal Judgment:\nThe formal notation for expressing the validation of an `if` instruction is:\n```\nC ` blocktype : [t* (input types)] -> [t* (output types)]\nC, labels [t* (output types)] ` instr*1 : [t* (input types)] -> [t* (output types)]\nC, labels [t* (output types)] ` instr*2 : [t* (input types)] -> [t* (output types)]\nC ` if blocktype instr*1 else instr*2 end : [t* (input types) i32] -> [t* (output types)]\n```\n\n### Key Details for Differential Testing:\n1. **Block Type Definition**: \n   - Ensure correct conversion and matching of block types to function types.\n   \n2. **Context Extension Propagation**:\n   - Validate that the labels in context `C` are accurately extended and maintained for inner instruction sequences.\n\n3. **Type Alignment Between Branches**:\n   - Both the `then` and `else` branch instruction sequences must conform to the defined function type and context constraints.\n\n4. **Input Stack Type Checking**:\n   - The correct type `i32` must be required right before checking the condition.\n\n5. **Exact Matching of Result Types**:\n   - `then` and `else` result types must match and conform exactly to the expected block type result.\n\nBy adhering to these detailed rules and constraints, differential tests can be generated effectively to identify discrepancies in how different WebAssembly implementations handle the `if` instruction.", "Absolutely, here are the key points relevant to the `br` instruction, extracted from the documentation, with a focus on constraints and conditions that strictly need to be followed when implementing it:\n\n1. **Label Definition Constraint:**\n   - The label `C.labels[l]` must be defined in the context.\n\n2. **Result Type Constraint:**\n   - Let `[t*]` be the result type `C.labels[l]`.\n   - The instruction must be valid with type `[t*1 t*] -> [t*2]`, for any sequences of operand types `t*1` and `t*2`.\n\n3. **Label Lookup Constraint:**\n   - The label index space in the context `C` contains the most recent label first, so that `C.labels[l]` performs a relative lookup as expected.\n\n4. **Stack Polymorphism:**\n   - The `br` instruction is stack-polymorphic.\n\n### Conditions and Constraints to Highlight:\n- **Label Definition**: It is crucial to ensure that the label `l` referenced by the `br` instruction is defined in the context `C`. An undefined label would result in an invalid instruction.\n  \n- **Result Type Matching**: The operand types that the `br` instruction consumes must match the result types `[t*]` associated with the label `l` in `C.labels[l]`. This must be true regardless of any other operand types `t*1` or `t*2`.\n\n- **Relative Label Lookup**: The label indices in the context are stored such that the most recently declared label is at index 0. This means that any reference to `C.labels[l]` should correctly reference the intended label by performing a relative lookup. Misinterpreting or incorrectly implementing this behavior could lead to erroneous br instruction handling.\n\n- **Stack Polymorphism**: The `br` instruction is stack-polymorphic. This implies that it can handle various stack configurations, consuming operand types `[t*1 t*]` and producing `[t*2]`. This distinctive property must be correctly implemented to ensure the instruction can validly execute under different stack conditions.\n\nSpecial attention must be given to these constraints to ensure compliance with the specification and to identify areas where differential behavior may emerge between implementations.", "To ensure the `br_if` instruction is implemented correctly across different WebAssembly (WASM) environments and to generate differential tests, here are the key points and constraints extracted from the official WebAssembly Specification, relevant to the `br_if` instruction:\n\n1. **Label Definition and Context**:\n   - **Constraint 1:** The label `C.labels[l]` must be defined in the context `C`.\n     - **Detail:** The context `C` contains a stack of labels, where `C.labels[i]` denotes the result type associated with the label at index `i`.\n     - **Potential Misinterpretation:** A lack of this label definition or an incorrect label index can result in an invalid instruction.\n\n2. **Result Type of the Label**:\n   - **Constraint 2:** Let `[t*]` be the result type associated with the label `C.labels[l]`.\n     - **Detail:** A result type `[t*]` refers to the sequence of operand types expected by the label. This information is used to validate if the operands provided to the `br_if` instruction match those expected by the label.\n\n3. **Instruction Type**:\n   - **Constraint 3:** The instruction is valid with type `[t* i32] ! [t*]`.\n     - **Detail:** This means the `br_if` instruction expects a sequence of operand types `[t*]` followed by an `i32` value (condition), and it leaves `[t*]` on the stack if the condition evaluates to false.\n     - **Potential Misinterpretation:** Implementers may incorrectly assume the order or the presence of the `i32` value, or the transformation of the stack post-instruction.\n\n4. **Relative Label Lookup**:\n   - **Constraint 4:** The label index space in the context `C` contains the most recent label first, so that `C.labels[l]` performs a relative lookup.\n     - **Detail:** Labels are stored in a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) manner. The most recent (`innermost`) label is at index `0`, the next at `1`, and so forth. The `br_if` label index is interpreted relative to this ordering.\n     - **Potential Misinterpretation:** Implementers might incorrectly index labels absolutely rather than relatively, leading to incorrect label references.\n\n5. **Stack Polymorphism**:\n   - **Constraint 5:** The `br_if` instruction is classified as stack-polymorphic.\n     - **Detail:** Stack-polymorphic instructions can perform control transfers that do not require precise stack adjustments before the transfer. The `br_if` instruction must accommodate different possible stack states.\n     - **Potential Misinterpretation:** Overlooking the polymorphic nature might lead to overly strict type-checking or insufficient stack validation before execution.\n\n### Nuanced Details Ensuring Correctness:\n- Ensure that label definitions in `C.labels` are correctly managed in the scope of nested control structures such as `block`, `loop`, and `if`.\n- Validate the correct number and types of operands `[t*]` before the `i32` condition on the operand stack. A mismatch should invalidate the instruction.\n- Confirm that instructions following `br_if` properly account for the modified stack in the context of conditionally breaking out of structured control flows.\n- Verify consistent indexing behavior, ensuring that all environments correctly interpret label indices relative to their definition scope.\n- Ensure proper handling and validation of stack-polymorphism, allowing for the stack to be in an acceptable state regardless of whether the branch is taken or not.\n\nTo generate differential tests, use these constraints to craft scenarios that test for various potential misinterpretations and ensure consistent and correct behavior across different WebAssembly implementations. This focus on detail and edge cases will help uncover subtle bugs and variations in how the `br_if` instruction is handled in different WASM environments.", "To effectively implement and validate the `br_table` instruction for WebAssembly and to generate differential tests, it's critical to adhere to all the specific constraints and conditions described in the official WebAssembly specification. Here are all the key points relevant to the `br_table` instruction extracted with precision:\n\n### Constraints and Conditions for `br_table`\n\n1. **Definition Context**:\n   - The `br_table` instruction requires a list of labels followed by a default label.\n\n2. **Validation Under the Context**:\n   - **Default Label (`lN`)**:\n     - The default label `lN` must be defined within the context `C`.\n     - Additionally, the operand type sequence associated with this default label must be known. This sequence is referred to as `C.labels[lN]`.\n\n   - **Target Labels (`l*`)**:\n     - Each target label (`li`) in the list of labels `l*` must also be defined within the context `C`.\n     - For each target label, the operand type sequence must match the default label's operand type sequence `C.labels[lN]`. These matching checks extend to include the length and type of sequences:\n       - Length of the operand type sequence for `li` must be the same as the length for `lN`.\n       - Each operand type `tj` in the sequence for `li` must match the corresponding operand type `t0Nj` in the sequence for `lN`.\n\n3. **Type Matching**:\n   - The `br_table` instruction must be valid with a specific stack type pattern, denoted as `[t*1 t* i32] ! [t*2]`:\n     - `t*1` and `t*2` can be any sequences of operand types.\n     - `t*` is the specific sequence of operand types that are validated against the labels.\n\n4. **Instruction Stack-Polymorphism**:\n   - The `br_table` instruction is classified as stack-polymorphic. This means the types it operates on can be relatively unconstrained, as long as the instruction\u2019s context-based condition checks are met.\n\n5. **Consistency of Operand Types**:\n   - All the operand type sequences referenced by the labels must be consistent:\n     - This consistency is established by the notation `(` [t*1] \\uf8ff C.labels[l] `)*`.\n     - Operand types in `t0*` must match corresponding types in `t*`.\n\n### Formal Judgments and Semantic Notation\n\n- Judgments formulated in the formal semantic notation ensure that the constraints are respected in any implementation. These include:\n  ```plaintext\n  C.labels[l] = [t*]\n  C ` br_table l* lN : [t*1 t* i32] ! [t*2]\n  ( ` [t*] \\uf8ff C.labels[l] )*\n  ` [t*] \\uf8ff C.labels[lN]\n  ```\n\n### Notes on Potential Misinterpretations\n\n1. **Initial Context Setup**:\n   - Ensure that all labels (`li` and `lN`) are explicitly defined within the context before referencing them in the `br_table` instruction, avoiding ambiguity in label indexing.\n\n2. **Operand Type Length and Matching**:\n   - Misalignment in operand type length between target labels and the default label will invalidate the instruction. Strictly verify the length before proceeding with validation.\n   - Pay careful attention to operand type compatibility and possible polysemy, especially given the instruction's stack-polymorphic nature.\n\n3. **Label Index Lookup**:\n   - Labels are indexed from the most recent as per the context order, so relative referencing might lead to errors if not correctly handled.\n\nBy adhering to these specific constraints and conditions, it allows for comprehensive differential tests to ensure diverse WebAssembly implementations conform strictly to the `br_table` instruction standard. These rigorous checks are designed to catch any potential misinterpretations or implementation nuances.", "Here are the key points and conditions strictly related to the `return` instruction from the provided WebAssembly specification:\n\n1. **Definition and Scope**:\n   - The `return` instruction is defined within the context of WebAssembly's control instructions.\n   - It affects the control flow by returning from the current function.\n\n2. **Type Validation**:\n   - The return type `C.return` must not be absent in the context.\n\n3. **Result Type**:\n   - Let `[t*]` be the result type of `C.return`.\n   - The instruction is valid with type `[t*1, t*2] -> [t*3]` for any sequences of operand types `t*1` and `t*2`.\n\n4. **Stack-Polymorphic Nature**:\n   - The `return` instruction is noted to be stack-polymorphic. This means it can have multiple valid stack types depending on the surrounding context.\n\n5. **Context Conditions**:\n   - `C.return` is absent (set to \u03b5) when validating an expression that is not a function body. This differs from it being set to the empty result type `([])`, which is the case for functions not returning anything.\n\n6. **Validation Rules**:\n   - Ensure `C.return` is correctly populated with `[t*]` relevant to the current function's return type.\n   \n7. **Additional Nuances and Conditions**:\n   - The `return` instruction must be used within a valid context where the function's return type is clearly specified.\n   - The stack-polymorphic nature allows it to adapt to different operand sequences, but any discrepancy in the operand stack must be managed to avoid type mismatch.\n   - The `return` instruction must be a part of a valid instruction sequence that adheres to the function's expected control flow and stack operations.\n\n### Conditions to Watch Out For:\n- **Absence vs. Empty**: Make sure `C.return` is not absent unless explicitly in contexts outside function bodies.\n- **Type Consistency**: Validate that `return` types (`t*1` and `t*2`) correctly map according to the function signature.\n- **Context Transitions**: Ensure context transitions correctly manage label stacks and return types within nested or compound instructions, avoiding misinterpretations.\n- **Polymorphic Handling**: Correctly handle polymorphic stack transitions, avoiding assumptions that could lead to type mismatches in different implementations.\n\nThese key points outline the specific constraints and nuances around implementing the `return` instruction in WebAssembly, ensuring rigorous validation and uncovering differential test cases.", "To implement differential tests for the `call` instruction in WebAssembly and find discrepancies across different implementations, it's essential to extract and parse out all specific constraints and conditions from the specification. Here are the key points relevant to the `call` instruction:\n\n### Key Points and Constraints Relevant to the `call` Instruction\n\n1. **Function Definition in Context**:\n   - The function `C.funcs[x]` must be defined in the current context.\n\n2. **Validity Check of Specific Function Type**:\n   - The type of the function `C.funcs[x]` must be valid according to the context.\n\n3. **Instruction Type Matching**:\n   - The instruction `call x` must strictly conform to the following notation:\n     ```\n     C.funcs[x] = [t*1] -> [t*2]\n     C ` call x : [t*1] -> [t*2]\n     ```\n     This denotes that the `call x` instruction consumes parameters `[t*1]` from the stack and pushes results `[t*2]` onto the stack, matching the type of the function being called.\n\n4. **Module Context Construction**:\n   - The context `C` for the module must be correctly constructed, keeping in mind:\n     - `C.funcs` should include both imported functions (from `it*`) and internal function types (`ft*`).\n\n5. **Global Sequence Validity**:\n   - Any globals referenced within the `call` instruction must be valid and correctly typed within the context.\n\n6. **Mutual Recursion Handling**:\n   - Most definitions in a module, including functions, are mutually recursive. Therefore, the context `C` depends on the outcome of function validations within the module.\n\n7. **Type Pre-Pass Requirements**:\n   - The types required to construct `C` (which includes function types) should be determined from a simple pre-pass over the module, not during actual validation.\n\n8. **Non-Recursive Evaluation of Globals**:\n   - Globals are not recursive and cannot be accessed within constant expressions when defined locally, impacting how they are validated in the context of a `call`.\n\n9. **Function Index Constraints**:\n   - The `call` instruction must use function indices that are valid within the scope of the module. This implies proper index referencing and avoiding out-of-bounds access.\n\n10. **Import and Export Validation**:\n    - Any functions being called that are imported or exported must conform to the specified types and constraints laid out in the context during module instantiation and export processes.\n\nBy being mindful of these constraints, differential tests can be constructed to detect different outputs across various WebAssembly implementations. These specific details ensure that subtle misinterpretations or minor deviations in implementation are identified. This approach will help in ensuring the consistency and correctness of the `call` instruction across all environments.", "From the WebAssembly Specification, Release 2.0 (Draft 2024-08-22), here are the key points relevant to the `call_indirect` instruction, with all constraints and conditions that must be strictly followed:\n\n1. **Context and Typing**:\n    - The context \\( C \\) specifies the environment in which the `call_indirect` instruction is validated, including tables, types, functions, etc.\n    - The instruction must be verified according to the context \\( C \\).\n\n2. **Definition Constraints**:\n    - **Table Definition**:\n        - The table \\( C.tables[x] \\) must be defined within the context.\n        - This specifically implies that there must be a valid entry for \\( C.tables[x] \\) in the context.\n\n    - **Table Type**:\n        - Let \\( \\text{limits } t \\) be the table type \\( C.tables[x] \\).\n        - The reference type \\( t \\) must be `funcref`.\n            - This demands that \\( C.tables[x] \\) corresponds to a table of function references.\n\n    - **Type Context**:\n        - The type \\( C.types[y] \\) must be defined in the context.\n        - This ensures that the function type \\( C.types[y] \\) exists and is valid.\n\n3. **Instruction Typing**:\n    - Let \\( [t_1^\\ast] \\rightarrow [t_2^\\ast] \\) be the function type \\( C.types[y] \\).\n    - The `call_indirect` instruction must then be valid with the type:\n        - `[t_1^\\ast i32] \\rightarrow [t_2^\\ast]`\n    - This involves:\n        - A sequence of operand types \\( [t_1^\\ast] \\) followed by an `i32` value for function index selection.\n        - Returning a sequence of operand types \\( [t_2^\\ast] \\).\n\n4. **Validation Judgement**:\n    - The validation judgement for the `call_indirect` instruction can be formally written as:  \n        \\( C.tables[x] = \\text{limits funcref} \\)  \n        \\( C.types[y] = [t_1^\\ast] \\rightarrow [t_2^\\ast] \\)  \n        \\( C \\vdash \\text{call_indirect } x y : [t_1^\\ast i32] \\rightarrow [t_2^\\ast] \\)\n    \n5. **Subtle Constraints**:\n    - **Boundary Conditions**:\n        - Ensuring that the table index \\( x \\) must be valid and within the bounds of the context\u2019s table definition and has type `funcref`.\n    - **Context Completeness**:\n        - The function type at \\( y \\) should be correctly indexed and should cross-reference accurately with the function types defined in the module.\n    - **Polymorphic Cases**:\n        - If operand type sequences \\( [t_1^\\ast] \\) or result sequences \\( [t_2^\\ast] \\) allow for multiple valid types, ensuring that all possible configurations of such polymorphism conform to the specification requirements.\n\nBy strictly adhering to these constraints and details, potential differential tests can be crafted to ensure that various implementations of the `call_indirect` instruction handle all nuances accurately, preventing misinterpretations and subtle bugs."]}
